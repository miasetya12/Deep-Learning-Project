A quantitative research method was used; the questionnaire for this study was posted on Wenjuanxing for data collection and 269 valid questionnaires were analyzed in September 2024 using partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of analyzing the 269 questionnaires showed that attitude, conformity, perceived behavioral control, and perceived quality of goods influenced shopping intention. However, face consciousness did not affect shopping intentions. Additionally, Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions influenced their shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea. The results of this study reveal the potential mechanisms of the influence of shopping intentions with conformity (a factor of Chinese-subjective norms) and the perceived quality of goods (a new factor) in shopping behavior, and they provide theoretical guidance and appropriate marketing strategies for companies in the Korean tourism field.Keywords:shopping behavior, modified theory of planned behavior, shopping tourism in Korea, Chinese tourists","1. IntroductionDue to the rapid growth of global tourism, Chinese tourists have emerged as a significant tourist group worldwide [1]. In 2019 alone, a staggering 154.6 million Chinese citizens traveled abroad, ranking first in the world [2]. One topic of great concern is that shopping has emerged as a crucial component of Chinese outbound tourism. Shopping tourism is a form of travel where the primary goal is to purchase multiple items that are difficult to find outside their place of origin and are appealing to tourists, which means that shopping is regarded as the “primary goal” in shopping tourism [3,4]. Additionally, Li et al. based their study on the finding that for Chinese tourists visiting other countries, shopping is the most significant activity [5]. As Tsang et al. argue, Chinese tourists’ primary reason for visiting Hong Kong is shopping [6]. However, there is currently a dearth of research on Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior, and many studies concentrate on Chinese tourists’ purchases of specific goods when traveling abroad [4,7].The Korean Wave is spreading throughout Asia, including China, which is close to Korea, as well as other nations [8]. Consequently, the Korean Wave has caused an increase in the number of foreign tourists—particularly Chinese tourists—visiting Korea [9]. The number of international visitors to Korea reached its highest level in 2019 with 17,502,756 people, and Chinese tourists held the top spot with 6,709,451 people [10]. Additionally, the Korean Wave has had a significant impact on Chinese tourists’ intention to shop when visiting Korea [11]. Yoon pointed out that shopping is the main reason that Chinese tourists come to Korea [12]. On the other hand, Seo et al. emphasized the significance of Japanese tourists’ shopping behaviors while visiting Korea [13]. Nguyen et al. investigated Vietnamese tourists’ preferences for shopping tourism in Korea [14]. As a result, shopping tourism is one of the primary strategic initiatives of nations when encouraging sustainable and high-quality tourism [15]. Korea is striving hard to develop as a shopping and tourism destination that is famous worldwide [16].Although many studies have been conducted on the overseas shopping behavior of Chinese tourists, previous studies have been general and lacked specificity [17], especially since there have been relatively few in-depth investigations into Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior in Korea. The theory of planned behavior is a commonly used research method for predicting consumers’ behavioral intentions. However, whether the theory of planned behavior developed in the United States is applicable to Chinese tourists is worth further empirical research [18,19,20]. Therefore, the following research questions are posed:(1)What factors affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions while shopping in Korea?(2)Does shopping intention affect shopping behavior within the modified theory of planned behavior?To address the problems mentioned above, we constructed a conceptual model of Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior based on the modified theory of planned behavior. The conceptual model of the modified theory of planned behavior in this study replaces the subjective norms of the original theoretical model of the theory of planned behavior with Chinese-subjective norms—the face consciousness and conformity variables—and secondly, a new variable, perceived quality of goods, is added to the original model of the theory of planned behavior to form the final framework model. The hypotheses were tested by using partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), determining the influence factors of Chinese tourists’ shopping intention, better understanding Chinese tourists’ behavioral motivations for shopping tourism in Korea, enhancing the image and status of Korea on the global shopping tourism market [21], and improving the satisfaction of shopping tourism for Chinese tourists [22]. On the other hand, this study aimed to identify the factors that influence Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions while shopping in Korea, thereby determining the relationship between shopping intentions and shopping behaviors, and expanding the application areas of the modified theory of planned behavior [23]. Additionally, this study provides insight into Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea [24], and the most innovative point was the use of the modified theory of planned behavior through the PLS-SEM method, which has not been carried out in previous studies. On the other hand, some practical implications for the tourism industry, retailers, policymakers, and the design of tourism products in Korea were outlined to provide directions for improving marketing strategies or services related to Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior and boosting the Korean economy [25].Therefore, this study is organized into the following sections:Section 1introduces the status of Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior and shopping tourism in Korea, the problems in Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior and shopping tourism in Korea, and the purpose of this study.Section 2presents the research hypotheses. Furthermore, based on a literature review, the shortages and limitations in previous studies are shown.Section 3discusses the research strategy, measurement items, survey development, data collection method, and analytical methods.Section 4outlines the results.Section 5concludes by highlighting possible discussions on the outcomes and presenting some implications. 

 2. Literature Review2.1. Shopping TourismDue to the discovery of the connections between purchases, motivations, and the choice of destination, the topic of “shopping tourism” has recently been a hot topic in academic studies and has become more and more important in the field of tourism [26]. Shopping tourism is travel in which the primary goal is to purchase multiple items that are difficult to find outside their place of origin and are appealing to tourists [17].Moreover, Liberato et al. claimed that shopping tourism is a major economic engine for tourism and commercial growth in several nations [26]. Wijayanti et al. found that shopping tourism has become one of the most popular kinds of tourism, and it creates economic chances for locals and has a positive influence on their well-being [17,27]. On the other hand, as Tomori argues, shopping has become a more and more important part of travel and accounts for a significant amount of tourists’ expenditures [28]. This means that shopping has developed into a determining factor when selecting a travel destination and the primary purpose for traveling [26].According to Timothy’s research, shopping tourism is growing in Europe, North America, and South America, and is having a significant impact on the economy [29]. However, there are few studies on shopping tourism in Asia, especially in Korea; thus, in this study, we selected Korea as the research nation. Lee et al. investigated whether the perceived tour quality had a positive effect on tourist satisfaction in Korea [30].Additionally, Lo and Qu found that the quality of goods has a significant impact on shopping behavior, which further shows that the theory of planned behavior applies to shopping tourism [31]. Unfortunately, there is only a limited amount of research on the theory of planned behavior in the academic literature on shopping tourism. Hence, this study was based on the modified theory of planned behavior to research Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior in Korea.2.2. Modified Theory of Planned BehaviorThe theory of planned behavior is an expanded version of the theory of reasoned action [32]. However, a rising number of studies have discovered that attitude and subjective norms cannot control actual behavior, and additional influencing factors must be added to the theory of reasoned action [33]. Therefore, Ajzen formalized a theory of planned behavior by adding a new variable, perceived behavioral control, to the basic theory of reasoned action [18]. According to the definition of the theory of planned behavior, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control act together as factors of behavioral intention that affect behavior.However, Seong and Hong proposed that the theory of planned behavior needs to be expanded to increase its explanatory power [34]. Hence, many studies have used the modified theory of planned behavior, especially in the field of consumer behavior within tourism [35].2.2.1. AttitudeAjzen proposed that attitude is a behavioral or emotional tendency to respond positively or negatively to a thing, situation, feeling, idea, or person [18], meanwhile Fishbein revealed that a person’s attitude toward engaging in a certain action might be positive or negative [36]. When an activity is positively evaluated, people will wish to engage in it. In this study, attitude refers to the psychological experience or evaluation of the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists while on a shopping tour in Korea. Chinese tourists are more likely to show a positive shopping intention when they have a positive evaluation of shopping during shopping tourism in Korea. However, Bangun and Handra argued that attitude cannot influence shopping behavior directly, as it is always influenced through intention [37]. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:Hypothesis1(H1).Attitude positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.2.2.2. Subjective NormsA subjective norm is a perception or point of view about the beliefs of others that affects one’s intention to engage in a behavior or not [18]. Normative belief indicates the extent to which one is motivated to adopt the viewpoint of others in connection to the behavior that they will perform [38]. Moreover, normative belief refers to expectations that are derived from people or organizations that are viewed as influential, such as parents, partners, close friends, or others, depending on the behavior involved [18]. Chinese scholar Li et al. argued that face consciousness and conformity represent the subjective norms in Chinese culture [39]. Thereby, a suitable model for Chinese cultural characteristics appeared and was confirmed. Hence, the subjective norms of this study involved three variables of face consciousness and conformity, which represented the subjective norms of Chinese culture. Moreover, Li et al. stated that face consciousness and conformity, as subjective norms, cannot directly affect behavior [39].Zhang et al. argued that Chinese tourists often place a high value on their group’s reputation and self-worth [40]. Face consciousness is referred to as “the social anchoring of oneself in the eyes of others or groups” [41].Loss of face means losing essential social respect in one’s own eyes and others. In other words, losing one’s respectable and good social dignity in the sight of others leads to feelings of humiliation and awkwardness [42,43]. Hsu and Huang regarded face consciousness as an essential variable in understanding Chinese tourists’ consumption behavior [23]. Hence, the definition of face consciousness in this study refers to a perception of one’s own status and reputation. Measurement items of face consciousness have been adopted in prior studies, and the measurement scales were modified [38]. We present the following hypothesis:Hypothesis2-1(H2-1).Face consciousness positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.Zhou et al. argued that conformity can be defined as someone’s intention to be affected by others and has a significant impact on behavioral intentions [44]. Susilawati and Nova found that conformity is a conscious or unconscious effort to alter one’s attitudes, behaviors, or views to fit a group [45]. Hence, as Pool and Schwegler argued, people tend to look to others for guidance when faced with uncertainties, especially in China, which focuses on a harmonious culture and group orientation [46]. Accordingly, the definition of conformity in this study refers to others in the group who are also shopping, which means that if others in the group are not shopping, the subject is also not shopping, and we expect the following relationship to hold:Hypothesis2-2(H2-2).Conformity (others in the group are also shopping) positively influences shopping intentions.2.2.3. Perceived Quality of GoodsPerceived quality of goods can be defined as a consumer’s belief in the excellence of a product that is perceivable. Moreover, the perceived quality of goods is determined by the customer’s perceptions of the total experience of using that good and is not limited to the attributes of a specific one [47]. Since fake goods have flooded the domestic market in China, whenever Chinese tourists can travel abroad, they choose to buy high-quality foreign goods [48]. Therefore, it is not difficult to find that Chinese tourists are very concerned about the perceived quality of goods. Meanwhile, with the popularity of high-quality Korean goods, many fake goods posing as Korean goods are circulating in the domestic market in China. Thus, Chinese tourists are willing to buy high-quality goods when shopping in Korea. Additionally, this study, to further understand the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists when shopping in Korea, introduced a new variable—perceived quality of goods—as this can make the modified model more comprehensive and convincing [49]. On the other hand, the perceived quality of goods is a visible and tangible variable that is different from attitude and subjective norms. Therefore, based on the theoretical and empirical studies above, we expect the following relationships to hold:Hypothesis3-1(H3-1).The perceived quality of goods positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.Hypothesis3-2(H3-2).The perceived quality of goods positively influences shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea.2.2.4. Perceived Behavioral ControlThe theory of reasoned action was expanded by Ajzen to include a new construct called “perceived behavioral control” as an additional determinant of both intention and behavior [18]. It refers to the perceptions of consumers of their power to complete a given activity. Specifically, Farooq et al. stated that when an activity is viewed as being very simple to complete, there is a great likelihood that people will carry it out [50]. Hence, the definition of perceived behavioral control in this study refers to the resources, situations, and possibilities that Chinese tourists are able to perceive, as well as how easy or difficult shopping is in Korea [51]. We propose the following hypotheses:Hypothesis4-1(H4-1).Perceived behavioral control positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.Hypothesis4-2(H4-2).Perceived behavioral control positively influences shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea.2.2.5. Shopping Intentions and BehaviorAzhar et al. argued that intention is a cognitive representation of one’s willingness to carry out a certain behavior, which implies that the most reliable predictor of actual behavior is intention, and an actual behavior can be realized if someone has the intention to engage in a behavior [32]. On the other hand, Brown et al. stated that consumers who express a willingness to purchase will have a greater percentage of actual purchases than consumers who express no desire to buy [52]. Moreover, Ajzen argued that intention has a significant influence on behavior [18]. Shopping intentions are defined in this study as the possibility of Chinese tourists performing a shopping behavior while shopping in Korea. Shopping behavior is defined in this study as Chinese tourists performing actual buying behavior while shopping in Korea [51]. As a result, based on the theoretical and empirical studies above, we hypothesize the following:Hypothesis5(H5).Shopping intentions positively influence shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea. 

 3. Methodology3.1. QuestionnaireThere were three sections to the official questionnaire. The respondents were first given a brief description of this research, and a filter question, “Do you have any travel experience in Korea?” was raised. No more questions were posed to those who answered “no”. Next, all of the measurement items for the variables in this study were obtained through a literature review. There were seven variables in this study, which were attitude (AT), face consciousness (FC), conformity (CO), perceived quality of goods (PQG), perceived behavioral control (PBC), shopping intention (SI), and shopping behavior (SB). Each variable had three measurement questions, and most of the measurement questions were used based on the previous scales in use for research and development. Depending on the circumstances, some dimensions needed to be adjusted. Meanwhile, the questionnaire was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale, where “1” meant strongly disagree, “2” meant disagree, “3” meant neutral, “4” meant agree, and “5” meant strongly agree. The 24 items in the questionnaire on the modified theory of planned behavior were based on the existing literature and were appropriately adapted to the topic of this study, as shown inTable 1. The final section investigated respondents’ backgrounds, including their gender, age, education, and monthly income. The establishment of this basic information can provide help in interpreting the results of this study.Table 1.Measurement.ConstructItemSourceAttitude (AT)I think shopping is a necessary activity when traveling in KoreaHanI think shopping is a wise choice when traveling in KoreaTaylor and ToddI think shopping is good for me when traveling in Korea[53,54]Face Consciousness (FC)While traveling in Korea, shopping can highlight my worth and positionLi et al.While traveling in Korea, shopping can make me respected by othersSomogyi et al.While traveling in Korea, shopping can allow me to gain respect[39,55]Conformity (CO)I will go shopping if most of my friends go shopping while traveling in KoreaLi et al.Maichum et al.I will follow the people with whom I am traveling in Korea to go shopping if they go shoppingI will choose the products that my traveling companions like while going shopping in Korea[39,56]Perceived Quality of Goods (PQG)When shopping in Korea, I feel that Korean goods are of good qualityErdogmus and Budeyri-TuranWhen shopping in Korea, I feel that Korean goods are reliableWhen shopping in Korea, I feel that Korean goods can be used without worryYen [49,57]Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC)It is easy to go shopping in Korea if I wantYadav and PathakNothing can stop me from shopping in Korea if I wantHanI have enough effort (time and money) to go shopping in Korea[51,53]Shopping Intention (SI)I want to go shopping if I have a chance to have a trip to KoreaLi et al.I plan to make a trip to Korea for shopping soonYenI plan to actively save money for shopping in Korea[39,49]Shopping Behavior (SB)I must go shopping during my trip to KoreaYadav and PathakI go shopping every time I travel to KoreaPerugini and BagozziEvery time I travel to Korea, I buy lots of Korean goods to take home[51,58]Open in a new tab3.2. Data CollectionThe questionnaire for this study was posted on Wenjuanxing (www.wjx.cn, accessed on 4 March 2023), which is a very popular website for designing online questionnaires in China. Since it is simpler to obtain a larger sample size and more replies, the use of online surveys in academic research has gained increasing acceptance [59]. Then, we pasted the final official questionnaire link into two instant messaging and social media applications, QQ and WeChat, which are widely used in China, and we asked users to help us collect responses. At the start of the survey on the Wenjuanxing website, we included a separate question to confirm whether respondents had traveled to Korea and shopped there within the last year. If they selected a negative option, the questionnaire was terminated. The surveys were given out starting from March 2023 to September 2024, and a total of 364 were given out. However, 95 respondents who filled out this survey in under 20 s or who checked a unified response were also disqualified, leading to the final collection of 269 valid surveys with an efficiency rate of 73.9%. Scholars recommend that when using PLS-SEM, the sample size should be at least ten times the number of measurement items across all constructs [60,61]. Accordingly, our sample size was sufficient for conducting PLS-SEM.Table 2displays the demographic characteristics.Table 2.Descriptive statistics (n= 269).ConstructItemFrequencyProportionGenderMale10037.2%Female16962.8%Age (in years)<18114.1%18–3013148.7%31–458933.1%>453814.1%EducationHigh school or below4516.7%Diploma3211.9%Bachelor’s degree10840.1%Master’s degree or above5821.6%Others269.7%Monthly income (CNY/Yuan)3000 or less7427.5%3001–50007929.4%5001–10,0006825.3%10,001 or more4817.8%Open in a new tab3.3. Data Analysis and TechniquesPartial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is appropriate for exploratory relationship analysis [60,62]. It is an effective method for examining diverse data structures [62]. Studies in the tourism field have applied PLS-SEM in various contexts, including museum marketing [63,64]. Therefore, SPSS v28 was adopted to screen and manage raw data and present the descriptive statistics first. Next, PLS-SEM analysis was conducted in two phases through SmartPLS 4.0: measurement model assessment and structural model assessment [65]. The path coefficient significance was tested using the PLS algorithm and bootstrapping with 5000 subsamples.Figure 1shows the results of the structural model analysis.Figure 1.Open in a new tabThe estimated structural model. 

 4. Results4.1. Measurement Model AssessmentFirst, an analysis of the partial least-squares structural equation modeling algorithm was used to test the validity and reliability of the measurement model. AsTable 3shows, each item’s loading values were higher than 0.7 (loadings ranging from 0.834 to 0.924), which proved that all items were significantly loaded, and their indicator reliability was verified [60,65].Table 3.Reliability and validity analysis.ConstructItemFactorLoadingsCronbach’s AlphaCRAverageVarianceExtractedAttitude (AT)AT10.8910.8930.8950.824AT20.924AT30.908Face Consciousness (FC)FC10.9010.8790.8820.804FC20.888FC30.902Conformity (CO)CO10.8610.8060.8070.721CO20.834CO30.852Perceived Quality of Goods (PQG)PQG10.8790.8760.8780.801PQG20.901PQG30.905Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC)PBC10.8960.8590.8590.780PBC20.889PBC30.864Shopping Intention (SI)SI10.8730.8650.8650.787SI20.897SI30.891Shopping Behavior (SB)SB10.8830.8780.8780.803SB20.906SB30.900Open in a new tabInternal consistency/reliability can be measured in two ways: composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach’s alpha (α). When the value of Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability for each item is over 0.7, the internal consistency/reliability of each latent variable can be proved [62,65].Table 3shows that Cronbach’s alpha values ranged from 0.806 to 0.893, and the composite reliability values ranged from 0.807 to 0.895.Then, an evaluation of validity was performed through convergent validity and discriminant validity [65]. According to Hair et al., the average variance extracted (AVE) can be considered a measurement of convergent validity, and each value of the AVE should be over 0.5 [62,66]. As can be seen inTable 3, all latent variables’ AVE values were over 0.7, which indicated good convergent validity.Next, the discriminant validity was determined by using the Fornell and Larcker criteria [62,67]. AsTable 4shows, all variables’ diagonal values (the square root of the AVE) exceeded the values of any other latent variables underneath them (AT = 0.908, FC = 0.897, CO = 0.849, PQG = 0.895, PBC = 0.883, SI = 0.887, SB = 0.896). Hence, the results conformed to the Fornell and Larcker criteria, and indicated adequate discriminant validity. As a result, the reliability and validity of the measurement model in this study were satisfactory.Table 4.Discriminant validity (Fornell).ATFCCOPQGPBCSISBAT0.908FC0.6460.897CO0.7530.6460.849PQG0.7380.6760.6650.895PBC0.7630.5580.6870.7020.883SI0.7880.5990.7340.7390.7320.887SB0.8300.6120.8060.7190.7660.8360.896Open in a new tab4.2. Structural Model AssessmentThe structural model in this study was assessed through the path coefficients R2(coefficient of determination) and Q2(PLS Predict) [62]. The collinearity assessment in this study was conducted using the variance inflation factor (VIF) before the structural model assessment. As Hair et al. argued, if the value of the VIF is high, the level of collinearity will be higher, which may cause a multicollinearity problem and make the model unreliable [65]. Therefore, when the value of the VIF is ≥5, a collinearity issue may arise. The values of the VIF in this study were all equal to or less than 3.058, which indicated that the model in this study was acceptable and had no collinearity issues.Afterward, the coefficient of determination (R2) was evaluated. R2refers to the explanatory power for all independent constructs [65]. Additionally, as Cohen argued, a value of R2over 0.26 indicates that the explanatory power is substantial [68]. Consequently, the values of R2for shopping intention and shopping behavior were 0.713 and 0.756, respectively, while the values of Q2were 0.697 and 0.729, respectively, indicating the sufficient explanatory power and predictive accuracy of the structural model (Table 5). Meanwhile, Cohen presented a value of f2over 0.35 as an indication of a high effect [68].Table 6shows that the highest f2value of 0.426 was observed in the relationship between shopping intention and shopping behavior, which indicated a high impact, and the lowest f2value of 0.023 was observed in the relationship between perceived quality of goods and shopping behavior.Table 5.Coefficient determination.ConstructR2Adj.

As a result, the structural model in this study had a favorable model fit. In summary, the structural model in this study had no collinearity problems and had sufficient explanatory power and predictive accuracy.4.3. Hypothesis TestingTo determine the significance of the path coefficients, a bootstrapping approach for PLS-SEM was used [65]. The results obtained after running the bootstrap routine are presented inTable 6. There was a significant relationship between the measured and latent variables when the t-value was >1.96 (p< 0.005) at the 95% confidence level (α = 0.05). Conversely, when the t-value was <1.96, there was no relationship between the measured and latent variables. The results showed that attitude (H1: β = 0.316, t = 3.975,p= 0.000), conformity (H2-2: β = 0.221, t = 3.093,p= 0.002), the perceived quality of goods (H3-1: β = 0.243, t = 3.727,p= 0.000), and perceived behavioral control (H4–1: β = 0.174, t = 2.791,p= 0.005) had positive relationships with shopping intention. Moreover, the perceived quality of goods (H3-2: β = 0.119, t = 2.098,p= 0.036) and perceived behavioral control (H4-2: β = 0.291, t = 4.931,p= 0.000) had relationships with shopping behavior. Furthermore, shopping intention (H5: β = 0.534, t = 7.906,p= 0.000) also had a significant effect on shopping behavior. Therefore, H1, H2-2, H3-1, H3-2, H4-1, H4-2, and H5 were supported. However, face consciousness (H2-1: β = −0.009, t = 0.172,p= 0.864) had no relationships with shopping intention because the t-values of the observed variables were all smaller than 1.96. Meanwhile, the number 0 was contained in the interval of BCI-LL and BCI-UL. Hence, H2-1 was rejected. 

 5. Discussion and Implications5.1. DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to investigate which variables affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions while shopping in Korea. Specifically, there are four determinants that can affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions which are attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control. However, this study found that face consciousness failed to have an influence on Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions.Attitude positively affects Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. This suggests that a positive attitude toward shopping tourism will positively influence Chinese tourists’ shopping intention for shopping in Korea. This is consistent with previous findings that positive attitudes increase consumer purchase intentions [70]. Additionally, Chinese tourists feel that shopping tourism in Korea is a wise and essential decision, and Chinese tourists are eager to shop during shopping tourism in Korea. The data also imply that Chinese tourists who have a positive attitude toward shopping tourism are more likely to decide whether they are willing to shop. Therefore, the findings reinforce the original theory of planned behavior [70,71].Conformity positively affects Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. This suggests that conformity to Chinese-subjective norms will positively influence Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions for shopping in Korea. This is consistent with the claim by Kai et al. that conformity has an important role in shopping intentions, and conformity affects Chinese seniors’ purchase intentions [72]. Meanwhile, this suggests that conformity with Chinese-subjective norms is an important factor influencing Chinese tourists’ willingness to shop, and it provides an important value for local Korean companies in developing shopping tourism marketing programs. Additionally, the data imply that Chinese tourists are willing to shop in Korea while following the relatives or friends surrounding them. Therefore, more attention should be paid to conformity with Chinese-subjective norms when conducting research on the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists in the future. However, Jin and Kang claimed that Chinese consumers’ conformity did not affect purchase intentions toward a US apparel brand, which was inconsistent with our findings. A very important point to note is that their study selected Chinese consumers living in economically developed areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc., whereas the selection of regions for this study included tourists from all regions of China, so the selection was broader and more representative. However, this provides a new direction for our future research on whether these findings are applicable in economically developed cities in China [73]. However, the Chinese-subjective norm of face consciousness did not affect the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. Outbound tourism is becoming more frequent and convenient in China. Moreover, shopping in Korea has become a common behavior for Chinese tourists. Chinese tourists feel that shopping in Korea does not highlight their worth and position [12]. This suggests that local Korean companies do not need to deliberately focus on the variable of face consciousness when marketing or designing tourism products, but they should rather design tourism products that are more suited to the needs of Chinese tourists.The perceived quality of goods significantly influences Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions and behavior. This suggests that high-quality goods will positively affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions in Korea. At the same time, high-quality items can also directly influence the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. These data also imply that high-quality goods in Korea are distinctively different from goods made in China, thus frequently attracting the interest of Chinese tourists and increasing their shopping intentions [4]. Hence, Chinese tourists are willing to shop in Korea directly due to the high quality of the goods, and the perceived quality of goods is an extension of the original theory of planned behavior [74].Perceived behavioral control positively affects Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions and behavior. Qin and Lee argued that it is very convenient for Chinese tourists to shop in Korea, and if they have enough resources (time and funding), they are willing to shop in Korea [75]. This suggests that Korean tourism companies should actively pay attention to providing a good shopping atmosphere to attract Chinese tourists. Additionally, a convenient shopping environment is more attractive to Chinese tourists. Meanwhile, Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions significantly influence their shopping behavior, which is in line with prior studies [76]. The data also imply that positive shopping intentions can greatly boost Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior. These findings highlight the importance of the modified theory of planned behavior for Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior.5.2. Implications5.2.1. Theoretical ImplicationsThis study offers precious contributions to the existing literature, specifically for the modified theory of planned behavior. The first purpose was to investigate the impacts of attitude, face consciousness, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control on shopping intentions.The results of this study showed relationships between attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, which were consistent with previous theories [77]. Therefore, this result reinforces the existing TPB. Moreover, the findings from this study enhance the understanding of Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea [4]. This study also shows that the perceived quality of goods is an important influencing factor for Chinese tourists in improving their shopping behavior during their shopping tourism in Korea [78]. The findings also broaden the current literature on the TPB and strengthen the existing TPB. Although previous studies on shopping behavior mainly focused on Western countries, the findings from this study suggest that the TPB is also suitable for Chinese tourists [71,79].Lastly, the findings affirmed the reliability and validity of the indicators of attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, perceived behavioral control, and intentions. These indicators have implications for the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. At the same time, these indicators were verified as robust based on existing theories and exhibited statistical significance. Furthermore, these indicators can also provide a solid foundation for future development of the modified TPB [80].5.2.2. Practical ImplicationsWith the rapid development of shopping tourism in Korea, more and more Chinese tourists choose to go to Korea for shopping tourism. Hence, tourism enterprises need to pay more attention to the aspects of attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control of Chinese tourists to attract more of them. The findings from this study have some practical implications for tourism enterprises trying to attract Chinese tourists. Specifically, they are reflected in the following aspects.First, a positive attitude has a significant impact on Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. Therefore, tourism enterprises should establish a positive brand image and make efforts to form positive attitude for potential Chinese tourists to gain a good impression through word of mouth [81].Second, the Korean government improves the perceived behavioral control of Chinese tourists and increases their shopping behavior by reducing shopping tourism costs and increasing the value perceived by Chinese tourists during shopping tourism in Korea [82].Third, the perceived quality of goods is an important influencing factor for Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior. High-quality Korean goods are more appealing to Chinese tourists, thus increasing their shopping intentions; therefore, enterprises should design high-quality and well-crafted tourism goods according to Chinese preferences [83].Fourth, Chinese tourists hold the view that face consciousness would not improve their shopping intentions. However, conformity is popular in China; Chinese tourists like to follow the actions of the surrounding people or things [84]. Hence, conformity is an important factor in Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. Korean tourism companies should develop appropriate marketing strategies to attract Chinese tourists based on conformity.Lastly, in order to promote the global tourism industry after the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government has launched a permanent visa-free policy with Thailand for ordinary citizens, which facilitates the economic and tourism exchange between the two countries. On the other hand, the Chinese government has implemented short-term visa-free access to Singapore and Malaysia. China has actively created mutual visa-free policies for ordinary citizens of Southeast Asian countries, which shows that China vigorously encourages Chinese people to travel abroad, which will promote the recovery and development of other countries’ economies and tourism. At the same time, China also hopes that the citizens of other countries will travel to China. Many cities in China have implemented visa-free policies for foreigners with 72 or 114 h of transit in order to help China’s economy, the world’s economy, and the tourism market recover. The Chinese government is also continuing to launch a series of favorable policies [85]. Therefore, the Korean government should seize this opportunity to keep attracting Chinese tourists to Korea, and local Korean companies should develop appropriate marketing strategies for Chinese tourists. 

 6. Conclusions, Limitations, and Future ResearchThis study investigated the factors affecting shopping behavior among Chinese tourists during shopping tourism in Korea. The key findings include the significant impact of attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control on shopping intentions, whereas face consciousness did not significantly affect shopping intentions. Furthermore, shopping intentions positively drove shopping behavior.Despite its contributions, this study has several limitations that need to be noted when interpreting the findings.First, most of the scale measures utilized in the questionnaire for this study were taken from well-known Western scales, but there was a lack of scales based on the Chinese cultural background in prior literature. Future studies can design more reasonable questionnaire items for the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. Additionally, experts’ opinions can be sought when designing measurement items to ensure, as much as possible, the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the measurement items.Second, there are still many factors affecting Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. In the future, we can think about adding control variables to group Chinese tourists for more in-depth research; for example, we can study whether gender affects shopping intentions and whether there are differences in shopping intentions between young people and older people. In other words, a thorough, in-depth investigation can improve the research model’s accuracy and dependability.Third, according to the data collected of this study, the target demographic was relatively young people (18–45 years old), making up 81.8% of the sample. The proportion of the elderly was not high, so the results of this study and whether it is representative of the elderly group need to be further verified. Hence, we can consider expanding the method of questionnaire distribution, such as through the use of offline questionnaires, which would be more targeted and allow for a more effective control of the number of young people versus old people. Another option is to work with travel agencies to distribute the questionnaire, which can save time and guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and extensiveness of the data."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11505588/,"AbstractCOVID-19 vaccination is a critical public health measure to control the pandemic, but disparities in vaccination uptake remain a concern. This study investigates the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination among Korean adults using the Andersen model. Data from 231,784 participants in the community health survey were analyzed using chi-square testing and logistic regression. The risk of non-vaccination was higher among those aged 19–64 (95% CI: 1.52–1.74), males (95% CI: 1.11–1.24), the unemployed (95% CI: 2.21–2.47), unmarried individuals (95% CI: 1.12–1.24), those with unmet healthcare needs (95% CI: 1.41–1.67), recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees (95% CI: 1.45–1.73), those with lower subjective health (95% CI: 1.20–1.30), individuals with depression (95% CI: 1.28–1.44), current smokers (95% CI: 1.13–1.30), and those skipping breakfast (95% CI: 1.04–1.16). Conversely, the risk was lower for those with less than a high school education (95% CI: 0.72–0.81), individuals with psychological concerns about infection (0.87, 95% CI: 0.82–0.92) or public criticism (0.91, 95% CI: 0.86–0.97), individuals with chronic diseases (95% CI: 0.64–0.72), and current alcohol consumers (95% CI: 0.52–0.58). These findings underscore the need for targeted intervention strategies and support systems to promote vaccination in vulnerable populations. Further research should explore the long-term impact of these interventions on vaccination uptake.Keywords:COVID-19, adolescent, vaccination, Andersen model","1. IntroductionThe onset of COVID-19 in January 2020 heralded an unparalleled global health crisis, leading to widespread fatalities and significant lifestyle changes. The virus’s highly contagious nature, coupled with the emergence of mutated strains, continues to pose concerns about sustained transmission and enduring societal impacts [1]. Despite global vaccination efforts, COVID-19 remains a substantial challenge. Vaccination is pivotal not only for preventing infection but also for reducing the severity and risk of death from the virus [2]. While surpassing the World Health Organization’s vaccination target, there is an ongoing need to investigate factors influencing vaccination rates, particularly among the unvaccinated population [3]. As new infectious diseases persist, research becomes crucial to enhance community vaccination rates.Prior studies have applied Andersen’s Model to discern factors affecting vaccination intentions [4]. The Andersen model, designed to predict individual use of medical services, categorizes factors into predisposing, enabling, and need factors [5]. Predisposing factors encompass demographic and sociological characteristics, enabling factors to cover aspects influencing the ability to use medical services and need factors pertaining to physical and mental health challenges [5].In a study examining college students’ COVID-19 vaccination intentions applying the Andersen model, factors such as demographic characteristics, the influence of peers, psychological predispositions, the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccine information, vaccine literacy, health status, and COVID-19-related experiences were considered [3]. Psychological predisposition significantly influenced college students’ COVID-19 vaccination intentions [3]. International studies have indicated lower vaccination intentions among women, younger individuals, those with lower education, and individuals in non-medical majors and occupations [6,7]. A prior investigation into factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination status among the elderly in China revealed that women, unmarried individuals, urban residents, and those with chronic diseases are less likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [8].Despite numerous studies on COVID-19 in Korea focusing on epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccination intentions for specific groups, there is a scarcity of research identifying factors related to the actual vaccination of the entire Korean population. This study aims to fill this gap by applying the Andersen model to national-scale survey data, seeking to uncover factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination and contribute to the development of community programs aimed at improving vaccination rates. Additionally, it is important to address factors such as concerns about side effects, confidence in vaccine effectiveness, influence from peers and family, and policies regarding free vaccine provision to ensure a comprehensive understanding of vaccination behaviors and hesitancy.Anderson ModelThe Andersen model, widely used in healthcare access studies, was selected for this research because it offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the multi-dimensional factors that influence health behaviors, such as COVID-19 vaccination. The model divides these factors into three categories: predisposing factors (e.g., demographic and psychological characteristics), enabling factors (e.g., resources or barriers to care), and need factors (e.g., health status and perceived need for care). These categories align well with the determinants explored in this study. Previous research has demonstrated the Andersen model’s effectiveness in examining vaccination behavior, particularly in understanding how individual characteristics, access to healthcare, and perceived needs influence vaccination decisions. By utilizing this model, we aim to identify the various factors that contribute to COVID-19 vaccination uptake among Korean adults. 

 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Data and SampleThis study utilized primary data from the 2022 Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS) conducted by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency between 16 August and 31 October 2022. The KCHS is an annual cross-sectional survey that employs a multistage, stratified area probability sampling method to select participants from civilian, non-institutionalized Korean households. Sampling is based on geographic area, age, and sex, ensuring representative data across different demographic groups. Data collection was performed through one-on-one in-person interviews using standardized questionnaires administered by trained surveyors.For the purposes of this study, participants who reported receiving a COVID-19 vaccination were initially considered. However, individuals who reported being unvaccinated were excluded from the final analysis. After applying these exclusion criteria, a total of 231,784 individuals were retained in the final dataset.2.2. Measurement2.2.1. Predisposing FactorPredisposing factors refer to the demographic and psychological characteristics of individuals that may influence health behavior. In this study, age was categorized into two groups: 19–64 and 65 or older. Gender was classified as either male or female. Job status was divided into those with an occupation and those without. Spouse status was categorized based on whether participants had a spouse or not, including those who were never married, divorced, or widowed. Education level was classified as either below high school graduate or college and above. Lastly, psychological concerns related to COVID-19 were measured by asking participants to rate their level of concern in three specific areas: (1) concern about infection, (2) concern about public criticism, and (3) concern about economic damage.In this study, psychological concerns related to COVID-19, such as fear of infection and economic anxiety, were considered part of predisposing factors. This is in line with the Andersen model, which allows for psychological characteristics to be included as individual-level factors influencing health behavior. Although these factors could also be viewed sociologically, they are incorporated here as predisposing influences based on individual perceptions and experiences.2.2.2. Enabling FactorsEnabling factors refer to conditions that either facilitate or hinder access to healthcare services. In this study, unmet healthcare needs were assessed by asking participants, “Over the past year, have you ever felt that you could not or did not access medical services when needed?” Responses were categorized as either “Yes” or “No”. The status of being a recipient of the national basic livelihood guarantee, a form of government-provided social assistance, was also considered. Additionally, region of residence was categorized based on participants’ living locations, grouped as either urban or rural areas.2.2.3. Need FactorsNeed factors most directly reflect access to medical care by highlighting disease characteristics. In this study, subjective health, stress, depression, chronic diseases, current smoking, current alcohol drinking, and eating breakfast were included. Subjective health was categorized as “very bad, bad, normal, good, and very good” and later reclassified as “above good” and “below normal”. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), recommended with a cutoff score of 5 [9] (Park et al., 2010). Chronic diseases included diagnosed hypertension and diabetes. Current smoking was determined by the question: “Do you smoke now?” Current alcohol drinking refers to those who consumed alcohol within the past month.2.3. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were presented as proportions and compared using chi-square tests to identify differences between groups. Binary logistic regression was used as the outcome variable (vaccination status), which was dichotomous.Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Univariate logistic regression was first employed to assess the crude relationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable (COVID-19 vaccination status). This step allowed us to identify the raw associations without adjusting for potential confounders.Following the univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding variables and determine the independent effects of each predictor on vaccination status. Variables that were significant in the univariate analysis (p< 0.05) were included in the multivariate model. The results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. 

 3. ResultsThe outcomes presented inTable 1illustrate an analysis of COVID-19 vaccination patterns concerning predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Among the participants, 3.4% reported being unvaccinated. The frequencies and percentage distributions of each categorical variable related to COVID-19 vaccination were derived using the χ2test. Non-vaccination rates were notably elevated among individuals aged 19–64 (71.4%), females (56.1%), those without an occupation (55.5%), individuals without a spouse (42.9%), those with education below the high school level (55.4%), individuals with psychological concerns about COVID-19 infection (60.3%) and economic repercussions (50.6%), those lacking psychological concerns about COVID-19 public criticism (55.5%), individuals with experienced unmet healthcare needs (9.6%), recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees (9.5%), urban residents (60.9%), individuals reporting higher subjective health (35.2%), those experiencing stress (74.8%), individuals with depression (24.8%), those without chronic diseases (73.3%), individuals who currently smoke (18.2%), those not currently drinking alcohol (73.3%), and those not having breakfast (60.4%).Table 1.General characteristics of COVID-19 vaccination.VariableTotal %Unvaccinated %Vaccinated %pPredisposing factorsAge19–6465.771.465.5<0.001≥6534.328.634.5GenderMale45.843.945.8<0.001Female54.256.154.2Job statusInoccupation37.255.536.5<0.001Occupation62.844.563.5SpouseAbsence34.142.933.8<0.001Existence65.957.166.2Education≤High school61.155.461.3<0.001>College38.944.638.7Psychological concerns of COVID-19InfectionYes64.560.364.7<0.001No35.339.735.3Public criticismYes49.544.549.7<0.001No50.555.550.3Economic damageYes54.150.654.2<0.001No45.949.445.8Enabling factorsUnmet healthcare needYes5.89.65.7<0.001No94.290.494.3Recipient of national basic livelihood guaranteesYes4.59.54.3<0.001No95.590.585.7Region of residenceRural43.539.143.6<0.001Urban56.560.956.4Need factorsSubjective healthBelow normal59.864.859.6<0.001Above good40.235.240.4StressYes73.874.873.70.037No26.225.226.3DepressionYes16.824.816.5<0.001No83.275.283.5Chronic diseaseYes35.326.735.6<0.001No64.773.364.4Current smokingYes16.418.216.3<0.001No83.681.883.7Current alcohol drinkingYes47.035.147.4<0.001No53.064.952.6Eating breakfastYes33.939.633.7<0.001No66.160.466.3Open in a new tabLogistic regression analyses were employed to assess the impact of predisposing, enabling, and need factors on COVID-19 vaccination (Table 2).

Males had 1.08 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.03–1.13) compared to females (reference group). Individuals without an occupation had 0.46 times lower odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 0.44–0.48), with those in an occupation serving as the reference group. The odds of non-vaccination were also 1.47 times higher for individuals without a spouse (95% CI: 1.40–1.54) compared to those with a spouse (reference group). Moreover, individuals with a high school education or lower had 1.28 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.22–1.34) compared to those with a college degree or higher (reference group). Furthermore, psychological concerns, such as fear of COVID-19 infection, were associated with a 1.21 times increase in the odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.15–1.26) compared to those without such concerns.In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for all variables, the risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination increased by 1.63 times for individuals aged 19–64 (95% CI: 1.52–1.74) compared to those aged 65 or older (reference group). Males had 1.17 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.11–1.24) compared to females (reference group). Individuals not in occupation had 2.34 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 2.21–2.47) compared to those with an occupation (reference group). The risk of non-vaccination was also 1.18 times higher for individuals without a spouse (95% CI: 1.12–1.24) compared to those with a spouse (reference group). In contrast, individuals with a high school education or lower had 24% lower odds of non-vaccination (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72–0.81) compared to those with a college degree or higher (reference group). Notably, psychological concerns, such as fear of COVID-19 infection, decreased the odds of non-vaccination by 13% (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82–0.92) compared to individuals without such concerns, while public criticism similarly reduced the odds by 9% (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86–0.97).In terms of enabling factors, individuals with unmet healthcare needs had 1.54 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.41–1.67) compared to those without unmet healthcare needs (reference group). Similarly, recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees had 1.59 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.45–1.73) compared to non-recipients (reference group).Regarding need factors, the risk of non-vaccination was 1.27 times higher for individuals with lower subjective health (95% CI: 1.20–1.30) compared to those reporting good health (reference group). Individuals with depression had 1.36 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.28–1.44) compared to those without depression (reference group). Current smokers had 1.21 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.13–1.30) compared to non-smokers (reference group), while not eating breakfast increased the odds of non-vaccination by 1.10 times (95% CI: 1.04–1.16) compared to those who ate breakfast regularly (reference group). Conversely, individuals with chronic diseases had 32% lower odds of non-vaccination (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.64–0.72) compared to those without chronic diseases (reference group), and those who consumed alcohol had 45% lower odds of non-vaccination (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.52–0.58) compared to non-drinkers (reference group). 

 4. DiscussionThis study examines the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination in South Korea using data from the 2022 Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS). Given that vaccination is one of the most cost-effective measures during public health crises, the Andersen model was employed to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the factors influencing vaccination decisions. The findings are consistent with previous studies while also revealing new insights into vaccination behavior in South Korea.Predisposing factors, such as age, gender, job status, marital status, education level, and psychological concerns about COVID-19, significantly impact COVID-19 vaccination. Individuals over 65, females, those employed, and those with spouses exhibited a lower risk of being unvaccinated, aligning with previous findings [10,11]. This trend could be attributed to the national vaccination program’s focus on individuals aged 65 and older, which successfully increased vaccination rates in this group. Interestingly, individuals with higher education (college level and above) showed a greater risk of being unvaccinated. This result contradicts some prior findings [11], suggesting that more research is needed to explore the influence of education on vaccine hesitancy. Psychological concerns related to COVID-19 underscore the need for psychological support programs, considering the psychological impact on the vaccination group. In preparing COVID-19 countermeasures, addressing psychological and social aspects, tailored to the varying levels of psychological concern, is imperative. Effective intervention and support systems are vital as community residents’ psychological concerns can influence their health and behavior [12]. Tailored psychological support and information campaigns should address these concerns to improve vaccination rates [13].Enabling factors like unmet healthcare needs and recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees were associated with higher risks of being unvaccinated. These findings underscore the necessity of targeted interventions for socially vulnerable populations, such as economically disadvantaged groups, who may face barriers to accessing healthcare [11]. Providing reliable information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, coupled with support systems, could improve vaccination coverage in these communities. Social distancing measures and the pandemic’s broader social impacts have further exacerbated the challenges for these populations [14].Need factors, including subjective health, depression, current smoking, and skipping breakfast, were also associated with a higher risk of being unvaccinated. People reporting poor subjective health or depression often display vaccine hesitancy [15], necessitating motivational and educational programs [16]. The association between smoking and vaccine distrust reflects the need for targeted interventions aimed at smokers [17], as smoking may contribute to vaccine hesitancy [18]. Skipping breakfast, often linked to poor nutrition, could impair immune function [19] and thus influence attitudes toward vaccination [20]. Interestingly, those with chronic diseases were less likely to be unvaccinated, suggesting that they understand the preventive benefits of vaccination, which is consistent with previous studies [21]. However, the lower risk of being unvaccinated among current drinkers contradicted earlier research [22], highlighting the need for further investigation.4.1. Strengths and LimitationsThis study benefits from the use of a large, nationally representative dataset, enhancing the generalizability of its findings. The application of the Andersen model also allows for a structured analysis of factors influencing vaccination behavior. However, a limitation is the absence of cognitive factors, such as knowledge and attitudes, which could further explain vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and more information becomes available, public perceptions of vaccines may change, which this study could not account for. Future research should include longitudinal data to capture these shifts.4.2. Implications for Policy and PracticeThe findings from this study highlight several areas for future action. First, psychological concerns and barriers to healthcare access must be addressed through targeted intervention strategies, particularly for economically vulnerable populations. Educational campaigns should focus on debunking myths about vaccines and promoting the benefits of vaccination, particularly among those with higher education and those who engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking. Public health strategies should also integrate tailored support for individuals with poor mental health and unmet healthcare needs, which could improve overall vaccination rates. 

 5. ConclusionsThis study identified key determinants of COVID-19 vaccination among Korean adults using the Andersen model. Gender, age, education level, job status, marital status, psychological concerns about COVID-19, healthcare access, unmet healthcare needs, mental health conditions, and health behaviors all significantly shaped vaccination patterns. The findings suggest that public health authorities should focus on disseminating reliable information about vaccines, especially to economically disadvantaged individuals and those with poor mental or physical health. Tailored intervention strategies are necessary to actively promote vaccination uptake, particularly among socially vulnerable groups. In future research, longitudinal studies will be essential to monitor changes in vaccine perceptions and behaviors as the pandemic and vaccination campaigns evolve. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on COVID-19 vaccination and provides a solid foundation for designing educational and policy interventions to increase vaccination rates."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11505557/,"AbstractTo improve older adults’ mental health, this study compared the effects of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT 3.0, with traditional mindfulness therapies on loneliness and depression in older adults. Despite interest in AI as a complementary tool, empirical evidence on its impact remains limited. For an eight-week intervention, older adult participants from two nursing homes in Hangzhou were assigned to groups focused on mindfulness (group sessions) and chatting (one-on-one ChatGPT). Following the intervention, participants engaged in a researcher-led focus group discussion. After 8 weeks, tension had decreased significantly (p< 0.05) in the Mindfulness group of older adults, and there was no significant difference between the effects of ChatGPT and mindfulness on the emotional intervention of older adults. Findings indicated three themes, including (1) personal experience, reflecting older adults’ use of AI technology and mindfulness; (2) attitudes and perspectives on the experiment’s desirability and insufficiencies; and (3) needs and expectations for future AI and mindfulness developments, including usability and functional preferences. Similar to mindfulness practice, ChatGPT interactions helped older adults feel less depressed and might eventually reduce costs by replacing mindfulness. In the future, AI can be integrated with conventional techniques to improve interaction by giving AI a more human-like appearance.Keywords:artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, mindfulness practice, older adults, negative emotions, life satisfaction","1. IntroductionGlobal aging and technological advancements have prompted researchers to explore how technology can support aging populations and enhance older adults’ well-being. The increasing prevalence of empty nesters, driven by demographic shifts and adult children’s independent living, has become a focal point of public interest. Empty-nested older adult people are those who do not have children living with them, which includes both those who do not have children and those who live separately from their children [1]. In comparison to non-empty nesters, empty nesters experience a markedly greater sense of loneliness and exhibit a complicated range of psychological reactions [2]. According to an Indian study, people who are empty nesters tend to have higher depression symptoms [3]. According to a study on the mental health of older adults in China, over 34% of survey participants displayed depressive symptoms [4]. The causes of negative emotions among older adults are varied, including their own physical health [5], social support [6], economic status [7], and living environment [8].Loneliness is a prevalent emotional distress among empty nesters [9,10], with one study reporting a mean loneliness score of 42.84 [11]. Loneliness occurs when an individual’s social expectations mismatch with their current situation [12]. The UCLA Loneliness Scale quantifies individual loneliness, with higher scores denoting greater loneliness. Loneliness in older adults is influenced by multiple factors, encompassing sociodemographic, physical, psychological, and cultural aspects, as well as social support [13]. Older adults who live in the outer suburbs are more likely to report loneliness than those who live in the city center. Older adults who live alone are more lonely than those who do not. Older adults with less education report being lonely more often than those with more. People with lower socioeconomic status reported more loneliness than older adults with higher socioeconomic status [14]. Physical pain and chronic illnesses exacerbate loneliness [15]. Insufficient social support correlates with loneliness [16], while social contact enhances mental health [17]. Loneliness can lead to negative consequences for older adults [18], including physical illness, depression, and suicide. It significantly lowers the quality of life and impairs social functioning in older persons who often lack coping mechanisms [19].Studies indicate a high prevalence of depression among older adults [20], ranging from 28.5% to 28.8% [21]. These findings imply that depressive mood is a common issue among older adults. Depression is a negative emotional experience dominated by low mood [22] and is a common adverse emotion in the older adult population [23]. The presence of depressive symptoms in older adults can be measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15). Many different and intricate elements can contribute to depression in older adults. Multiple factors contribute to depression in older adults, including lack of companionship in empty nesters [24], advanced age, marital status, poor finances, sleep quality, chronic diseases, and living conditions [25]. Sedentary lifestyles [26] and limited social participation [27] also correlate with increased depressive symptoms. Depressed mood can significantly impact older adults’ physical and mental health, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions [28]. It may disrupt sleep patterns [29], negatively affect physical health perceptions [30], and impair social functioning and quality of life [31].Interventions for mood disorders in older adults include pharmacological treatments, psychotherapy, physical activity, social support, cognitive training, mindfulness practices, and chat-based care. For severe mood disorders like depression, medication is commonly prescribed to older adult patients. Various antidepressants are commonly used to treat geriatric depression [32]. In addition to medication, psychological intervention is also one of the most important means of treating geriatric depression. When used in conjunction with medication, psychological therapies can significantly improve the quality of life for older adults people suffering from depression [33]. Psychological relief therapy lowers sadness and anxiety by assisting patients in understanding and addressing the feelings and thought processes that contribute to depression [34]. In conclusion, psychological intervention and other non-drug therapies can be added to the medication regimen for older adult patients experiencing loneliness and depression in order to enhance both the therapeutic outcome and the patient’s quality of life. The medication regimen should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient and take into account their unique circumstances.The improvement strategy for older persons experiencing depressive symptoms without a particular diagnosis should include social support, non-pharmacological therapy, emotional control techniques, and telemedicine care. Research has demonstrated that cognitive reappraisal techniques, which entail modifying one’s interpretation of occurrences and, as a result, the emotional reaction, can successfully lessen depressed symptoms [35]. Family support, hobbies, and physical activity are forms of social support associated with reducing depressive symptoms [25]. Individual nostalgia therapy can alleviate depression and reduce loneliness in geriatric internal medicine patients [36].Mindfulness-based therapy is an intervention that has proven to be effective [37]. Mindfulness refers to a process that cultivates a state of mind characterized by non-judgmental awareness of the present moment, including one’s feelings, thoughts, bodily sensations, consciousness, and environment, while promoting openness, curiosity, and acceptance [38]. The fundamental premise of mindfulness practice is that experiencing the present moment without judgment and with openness can effectively counteract the effects of stressful stimuli [39]. Baer suggests that mindfulness therapy may be beneficial in treating anxiety and mood disorders [40]. Research indicates that mindfulness therapy is particularly effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals with mood disorders, surpassing the placebo effect significantly [37]. In one systematic review, seven out of nine studies concluded that mindfulness therapy was advantageous for older adults experiencing anxiety or depression [41]. Another study found mindfulness therapy to be an acceptable approach for alleviating depressive symptoms in individuals aged 65 and older [42]. Therefore, this study will incorporate mindfulness as one of the interventions to enhance mood in older adults.Chat nursing, a model well-suited to older adult patients’ characteristics, effectively alleviates depression among elderly inpatients [43] and plays an irreplaceable role in humanizing their care [44]. Traditional chat care, while providing timely feedback and emotional support, faces practical limitations such as labor costs and geographic constraints. Technology-based chatting offers a viable alternative. Smartphone apps and online platforms can overcome these limitations, enhancing flexibility and convenience in caregiver-older adult communication [45]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) develops computational systems that simulate human intelligence tasks. Generative AI, a subset relying on machine learning and deep learning, includes ChatGPT. This AI-powered chatbot provides tailored, intelligent conversational experiences by generating responses based on user input [46]. As a dialogue-based AI model, ChatGPT offers personalized, specialized, and real-time health information and support, surpassing traditional chat care. This is especially vital for older adults requiring close health monitoring [47]. ChatGPT offers unrestricted companionship for older adults, providing privacy and freedom of expression for shy individuals. However, it lacks genuine human interaction and emotional support. Technical barriers for some older adults may limit its accessibility. Consequently, ChatGPT’s effectiveness for older adults’ care requires further research. ChatGPT integrates current psychological intervention strategies, aiding nurses in scientific mental health assessments. Through personal accounts, it enables early identification and intervention for negative emotions via continuous interactions. By integrating multimodal data, ChatGPT provides nurses with comprehensive insights, enhancing the effectiveness of psychological interventions [48]. ChatGPT self-identifies as a potential source of companionship and comfort for isolated older adults through conversations and interactions. Research confirms that communication technologies can help alleviate loneliness and social isolation in older populations [49]. Advanced language models like ChatGPT show the potential to enhance social engagement and alleviate loneliness among older adults while reducing labor costs. Consequently, this study will employ ChatGPT companion chats as an intervention to improve mood in older adults.Negative emotions such as loneliness and depression are common challenges faced by older adults, especially empty nesters, and can significantly impact their quality of life and social functioning. There are various programs, such as medication and psychotherapy, to deal with the problem of bad moods in older adults. The focus of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two modalities, ChatGPT Companion Chats and Mindfulness Exercises, in improving the negative moods of older adults, such as loneliness and depression. It is hoped that ChatGPT companion chats, as a novel technique, can alleviate negative moods in older adults. For older adults with medical conditions, ChatGPT companion chats may complement medication to enhance treatment effectiveness. Our research is motivated by a desire to contrast traditional, relatively specialized approaches with modern, technology-driven alternatives. Explore more possibilities for addressing mental health challenges in older adults. The study hypothesizes that both ChatGPT companion chats and mindfulness exercises could alleviate loneliness and depression in older adults, with no clear expectation of which intervention would yield superior results. Manual intervention usually requires trained professionals and is limited by time and place. This study hopes to explore the possibility of artificial intelligence replacing human intervention. Therefore, the focus of this study is to explore whether AI is effective in emotional intervention rather than to prove that ChatGPT is superior to mindfulness. 

 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study DesignThe study used a controlled design to compare the effectiveness of ChatGPT Companion Chats and Mindfulness Exercises in improving loneliness and depression in older adults. Based on previous studies [50], an 8-week experiment was conducted in which participants were assigned to either the ChatGPT Group or the Mindfulness Group. Participants engaged in ChatGPT Companion Chats or Mindfulness Exercises for 15–30 min once a week. The researchers recorded participants’ mood, life satisfaction, and other relevant metrics at baseline (week 0) and at the end of the study (week 8).2.2. Ethical ConsiderationsEthical approval for the experiment was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University. The study’s details were approved by the participating organizations’ management. Informed consent was acquired from participants or primary caregivers. Participants could withdraw at any time. All information was anonymized, participation was voluntary, and confidentiality was assured for both participants and collaborators.2.3. ParticipantsNursing homes provide a uniform environment for older adults, reducing sample heterogeneity and controlling for potential confounders in experimental settings. Researchers contacted two local nursing home directors to recruit participants. Inclusion criteria were age over 60, Mandarin communication ability, and normal cognitive function (MMSE score > 26) with basic mobility and communication skills.2.4. Allocation to InterventionsParticipants from two Hangzhou nursing homes were divided into ChatGPT and Mindfulness groups. Each group underwent weekly 30-min sessions for 8 weeks. Loneliness, depression, and life satisfaction were measured pre- and post-experiment. Post-experiment focus group discussions were conducted. Only participants completing all sessions were included in the data analysis.2.4.1. ChatGPT GroupParticipants sat at a computer with a researcher providing assistance (Figure 1). The ChatGPT chatting method was explained, and both used headsets. Participants communicated verbally, with input converted to text and manually corrected if necessary. ChatGPT replies were presented as voice output to simulate live chat and reduce the reading burden. Researchers assisted with technology but did not interfere with chat content. The first session familiarized participants with the chat style, followed by seven 15–30 min one-on-one sessions.Figure 1.Open in a new tabChatGPT group.2.4.2. Mindfulness GroupA professional counseling expert-led participants in routine mindfulness practice, with researchers observing and assisting (Figure 2). Sessions followed the ‘Eight-Week Mindfulness Journey’ published by China Light Industry Publishing House, with varying content each week. Eight sessions were conducted in a one-to-many format. Specifically, this format refers to the structure where one facilitator (e.g., the mindfulness instructor) interacts with multiple participants simultaneously during the intervention sessions. The mindfulness sessions were conducted in a group setting, where the instructor guided the entire group of participants together.Figure 2.Open in a new tabMindfulness group.2.4.3. Focus GroupsFocus group interviews were conducted to gather supplementary insights. Two sessions were held following the conclusion of respective sub-experiments, each lasting approximately 30 min. The ChatGPT group comprised 2 researchers and 4 participants, focusing on the ChatGPT chaperone chat. The mindfulness group consisted of 2 researchers and 8 participants, centered on mindfulness practice. Researchers facilitated discussions as moderators and observers, respectively responsible for guiding topics and recording dialogue. The format included establishing rules, outlining objectives, in-depth discussions, and concluding remarks. Topics encompassed user experiences post-intervention, including prior usage, satisfaction, intervention impact, and interaction feedback. Researchers concluded sessions by expressing gratitude and encouragement to participants for their full participation, recognizing their adaptation to new technology, and ensuring a positive engagement experience.2.5. MeasurementsThis study utilized five scales, namely the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15), the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and the System Usability Scale (SUS).2.5.1. The Emotional State of Older AdultsAssessment of older adults’ emotional states utilized three mood scales. The Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15), developed by Sheikh and Yesavage, gauged depression symptoms with 15 yes-or-no questions. Scores, ranging from 0 to 15, indicated severity: 0–4 (none), 5–9 (mild), 10–14 (moderate), and 15 (severe) depression. The UCLA Loneliness Scale by Russell et al., comprising 20 items, measured loneliness on a 4-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. The Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) assessed older adults’ mood states via 32 items on a 4-point scale, delineating results across eight mood dimensions.2.5.2. Life SatisfactionThe Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), developed by Pavot and Diener, was used to assess psychological satisfaction with life among older adults, which was a measure of subjective well-being. The scale comprises 5 items rated on a 7-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.2.5.3. System UsabilityThe System Usability Scale (SUS), developed by Brooke, was used to measure the perceived usability of a product or system. It consisted of 10 items and was divided into three subscales: ‘Effectiveness & Learnability’, ‘Use Efficiency & Usability’, and ‘Satisfaction’. The scale employed a 5-point rating system. The SUS usability score was calculated based on a formula, with higher scores indicating better system usability.2.6. Data AnalysisThe measurement data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 27. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were performed with SPSS. Since the normal distribution was not satisfied, the Mann–Whitney test was used for comparison between the two groups, and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was used for comparison between the two groups. Process data and focus group content were analyzed using thematic analysis with MAXQDA 2020 [51]. Audio data were transcribed, and initial coding of raw text data was performed. A coding library was developed, followed by grouping data in a second round of coding. Researchers identified categories and themes, refining final themes based on Renn’s adaptation [52]. 

 3. ResultsThe chat companion experiment enrolled 15 participants, averaging 80.4 years old. Four females completed the process, averaging 88 years old, and were included in the final analysis. The mindfulness experiment involved nine participants, averaging 79.6 years old. Eight participants (seven females and one male) completed the process, averaging 78.6 years old, and were included in the final analysis.3.1. Participant CharacteristicsTable 1shows the demographic variables and baseline results of all participants who completed the study. The majority of participants were female, with 11 (91.7%) female and 1 (8.3%) male. One participant (8.3%) had no formal education, six participants (50%) had primary school education, two participants (16.7%) had middle school education, two participants (16.7%) had high school education, and one participant (8.3%) had a university degree. Aside from the difference in educational background (p= 0.036 < 0.05), where the Chat group had a higher education level than the Mindfulness group, there were no significant differences between the two groups in other conditions. Ten participants reported mild depressive symptoms, and one participant reported moderate depressive symptoms.Table 1.Participant characteristics (n = 12).VariableChat (n = 4)Mindfulness (n = 8)pn (%)MedianQ1n (%)MedianQ1GenderMale4 (100.0)7 (87.5)0.480Female0 (0)1 (12.5)Educational backgroundnot attending school0 (0)5.02.81 (12.5)2.02.00.036 *secondary schools1 (25.0)5 (62.5)Junior high school0 (0)2 (25)three-year college0 (0)0 (0)High school2 (50.0)0 (0)University1 (25.0)0 (0)postgraduate education0 (0)0 (0)GDS-15 score6.03.87.06.00.146UCLA score12.07.814.04.80.932BRUMS scoreanger2.51.32.50.31.000tension3.01.31.50.30.227depression1.50.31.00.00.663vigor4.50.39.07.30.119fatigue7.52.83.01.30.147confusion4.02.31.00.30.086happy7.004.811.010.00.057calmness11.57.012.09.30.665SELE score22.519.327.526.00.230Open in a new tab*p< 0.05.Table 2shows the changes in outcomes for the different groups.

There was also a certain degree of increase in vitality, happiness, and life satisfaction, but loneliness also increased. The participants in the mindfulness group showed a decrease in depression scores. Among them, one participant transitioned from moderate to mild depressive symptoms, and one participant transitioned from mild to moderate. There were no significant between-group differences in any of the data, suggesting to some extent that there is no difference in effectiveness between ChatGPT chaperone chat and mindfulness practice.3.2. Thematic AnalysisTwo focus group sessions were conducted, with four participants engaging in discussions on ChatGPT chaperone chat and eight participating in discussions on mindfulness practice. Qualitative analysis of the chat content and focus group discussions revealed three main themes and their subcategories (Table 3), with representative quotes explaining each category.Table 3.Themes and categories reported by participants after the focus group.ThemesCategoriespersonal experienceExperience with AI or mindfulnessThere is a dependence on smartphonesNew to AI/mindfulnessAttitudes and perspectivesThere are benefits to chatting with ChatGPT or mindfulness practiceChange in moodDo not think this is a good form of AINeeds and expectationsPrefer bionic-looking forms, real human contactImpact of hearing deteriorationI hope to be able to use it in my daily lifeOpen in a new tab3.2.1. Personal ExperienceAll participants reported no exposure to ChatGPT. However, some participants mentioned similar experiences with AI contact. For instance, subject d (84 years old) remarked, ‘Sometimes when I go to the hospital with a cold, there will be a robot, and you can ask it which ward is on what floor. Which floor should I go to if I want to see a doctor’. The conversational pattern of the hospital guide robot bears some resemblance to the experimental intelligent companion chat, which brought a sense of familiarity to older adults. The study suggests that older adults find the use of AI technology acceptable. They perceived that service robots could assist them in performing their daily tasks more effectively [53]. Some participants had prior exposure to mindfulness or similar exercises, such as meditation. Subject k (78 years old) commented, ‘I’ve learned some relaxation and meditation techniques at the community center before, but I haven’t practiced them systematically’.Several participants indicated that they have experience with smartphones, and some exhibit a strong dependency and fondness for them. Subject c (92 years old) mentioned in the chat, ‘My daughter took my smartphone away, which makes me quite angry right now. I am really sad inside without it. Since I’ve had a smartphone for 14 years, I will not use a senior phone. When I’m without my smartphone, I get sad’. Studies reveal a favorable relationship between the amount of time spent on smartphones and smartphone addiction [54]. Subject c (92 years old) was the participant who had been using a smartphone for a long time and showed a strong need for it. Another participant mentioned, ‘I use my phone to read the news and watch wellness programs, especially medical-related ones. It’s important to have some understanding, and I enjoy it’. This suggests that older folks, who can also use smart technology and benefit from its convenience, have found greater ease in their lives as a result of its advancements. However, some older adults said that they feel unfamiliar with artificial intelligence because they do not have a smartphone but only an old-age phone. In a similar vein, some older adults have never heard of mindfulness. Subject h (85 years old) stated, ‘I have never come into contact with mindfulness; this is kind of my first experience and I find it quite refreshing’.3.2.2. Attitudes and PerspectivesSome older adults who experience a chaperoned conversation say they benefit from it and will prepare for it or look forward to it before they have it. Subject d (84 years old) would set a theme or question for herself before each conversation, and the conversation would revolve around the theme. She said during the discussion: ‘Every conversation, I thought of a question and it would give me a more comprehensive answer than what I had thought of on my own. It knows a lot about what’s going on in life. Once I asked it about its views on genetically modified foods and its answer was not one-sided. I think that’s still instructive’. Many older adults expressed positive attitudes towards mindfulness. A subject said, ‘I feel that mindfulness practice has not only brought me peace and relaxation mentally but has also had a positive impact in other aspects of my life. For example, I find myself paying more attention to healthy eating and getting enough sleep, as well as paying more attention to the good things around me’. And the subject said, ‘I think mindfulness practice has made me appreciate each day more’. Participants in both groups saw their life satisfaction scores rise after the intervention, and the upward trend was close to significant.There were also older adults who gradually began to change their attitudes as the chatting progressed. Subject a (88 years old) conversations started with ‘no’, ‘I have nothing to say’, and ‘there is nothing I want to ask’. After that, she started to chat and would take the initiative to greet, ‘Old friend, we meet again, how are you’. The change in response also reflects the change in mood and emotion of older adults. Older adults grew more laid back and gregarious as the number of interactions rose. Some older adults also said: ‘I feel better after chatting’. Additionally, compared to non-users, internet users reported feeling more support from friends and family [55]. On the other hand, participants in the mindfulness group mentioned certain challenges they encountered. ‘During the experiment, sometimes I would feel that I lacked motivation and patience and it was hard to keep going’. ‘Sometimes my thoughts would wander to other places and it was hard to concentrate’.Some of the older adults involved in the chat group expressed that the experimental format was less engaging and that the requirement for standard Mandarin in dialog recognition posed challenges. For example, subject d (84 years old) said: ‘Young people speak good Mandarin, but my generation didn’t have pinyin or anything like that when we were studying, so we usually spoke dialects. I’m from Ningbo and speak the Ningbo dialect, so it doesn’t understand this dialect’. Another subject said, ‘Sometimes the words I say are not understood by it, and you have to adjust them on the side, or the words that appear differ from what I say’. The care home’s director remarked, ‘This companion talk feels a touch too robotic. It’s quick and rigid. Older adults are bored and unable to use computers when they are using them’. Research indicates that older adults experience declines in language comprehension with age, leading to poorer performance compared to younger counterparts in understanding complex conversations [56]. Hence, there is a need for further refinement of the current form of accompanied conversation to enhance older adults’ comprehension and utilization of this technology.3.2.3. Needs and ExpectationsNumerous individuals have shared their opinions and views on AI technology. Older adults typically communicate online through voice or handwritten text, so visual and auditory aspects are highly valued by them during accompanied conversations. Some older adults may prefer forms that imitate real beings, such as charming and cartoonish designs, like little animals. Robots are not very popular. A subject said: ‘If the robot is a very cute shape, like a Barbie doll or a big monkey, it will also offer to say hello. That kind of is very likable’. Some participants indicated that sight and hearing include not only appearance but also mannerisms and tone of voice, and some expressed a preference for interacting with real people. The director of the nursing home said: ‘Older adults prefer their children to come and see them offline when they live here, not just through a telephone greeting. They prefer real contact. Older adults also rarely use video calls’. Additionally, prior research has demonstrated that older persons still prioritize face-to-face communication above other forms of communication, even despite the rapid advancement of online communication tools [57].Researchers observed the impact of hearing loss on older adults during both the process and interviews. Due to age-related decline, their ability to use voice-based systems was affected [58], necessitating devices with higher volume. During the experiment, some older adults opted to read text responses because they could not hear the device’s voice replies clearly. Some subjects said, ‘It’s not that they don’t want to use a smartphone, but senior phones are simpler and loud’. Thus, auditory design is a point of concern for products used by older adults.Participants in the mindfulness group showed a highly positive attitude towards this format, expressing a desire for deeper understanding and the ability to apply it in their daily lives. Subject g (78 years old) said, ‘I learned some practical skills and strategies through this experiment. I hope I can better apply mindfulness practice in my future life’. Subject l (80 years old) said: ‘I think mindfulness has helped me with my emotional management. I hope I can still learn more to apply it to my life and improve my quality of life’. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that mindfulness training can improve the mental and physical health of older adults by teaching them to accept and cope with chronic illnesses more effectively [59]. 

 4. DiscussionOverall, we discovered that individuals’ feelings of depression and loneliness did not significantly change as a result of either ChatGPT companionship or mindfulness practice. Nonetheless, following the intervention, the data showed a decrease in negative emotions in both groups, with no discernible variations between the groups. This inadvertently implies that ChatGPT can function similarly to mindfulness in mitigating negative emotions in older adults and that both companionship and mindfulness have similar benefits in decreasing negative emotions in older adults.In particular, after the trial, Subject h (85 years old) depression score dropped from 11 (moderate depressed symptoms) to 5 (mild depressive symptoms). He said he ‘felt much better mentally, and the worries were not as heavy’ following the practice. This is similar to Subject g (80 years old), ‘performing these exercises helped my mind feel extremely relaxed; I used to overthink a lot’. Subject d (84 years old) saw a decrease in her depression level in the ChatGPT group as well. ‘Chatting with ChatGPT was quite enjoyable; it felt like catching up with an old friend’, the woman said.After the trial, the loneliness score of the 85-year-old individual increased from 4 to 13. ‘I used to think about the past when I meditated, and now I feel more and more alone’, she said in her explanation. In contrast, there were notable individual variances even while the ChatGPT group’s aggregate level of loneliness rose. For instance, the loneliness score of subject b (88 years old) dropped from 24 to 7. ‘ChatGPT feels like my little companion, someone I can talk to’, she said with a smile.There could be several factors contributing to these outcomes. First of all, medical issues, social support, and familial ties are just a few of the variables that can impact depression and lonely experiences in older persons [60]. It may not be possible to achieve notable benefits with a single, brief session. Second, research from the past suggests that emotional state modifications take time [61], so the 8-week intervention period may not be long enough to see the full benefits. Individual psychological adjustment capacities may also have an effect on the results. For instance, Auntie Cheng, who finished the study, saw a decline in her physical well-being and a reduction in family visits, both of which added to her depressive feelings.During the experiment, a few notable situations were noted. There was no visual interface during the technology-assisted chat sessions, so communication was restricted to text and speech. Both visual attractiveness and engagement suffered as a result. A higher dropout rate was also caused by the older adults’ decreased capacity to adopt new technology. However, several participants thought that mindfulness exercises were abstract. ‘I don’t entirely comprehend the importance of those behaviors’, said subject j (74 years old). It is interesting that in the chat group, the four who completed the process are nearly 8 years older than the average for the 15 that started. Older participants may have had more time or motivation to complete the intervention, which could be a factor worth exploring in future studies. One of the limitations of the study is the relatively small and unbalanced sample sizes, with 15 participants in the ChatGPT group and 9 in the mindfulness group. This may limit the generalizability of the results. We observed several compliance-related challenges during the study. Some participants struggled to maintain consistent engagement with the 8-week intervention. For example, some participants stopped participating midway because they went to the hospital for treatment, and some participants refused to continue because they were not willing to express themselves. Future research could benefit from larger, more balanced samples to improve statistical power and the reliability of the findings.In conclusion, despite the little overall improvement, the majority of participants expressed a greater sense of life satisfaction and gave the experimental forms positive feedback. This result is consistent with other research that indicates mindfulness techniques [62] and virtual communication [63] can provide older persons with social support and coping mechanisms, which can improve their quality of life [64]. Thus, we think that in the future, offering older adults a variety of easy social and psychological support channels through the use of technology and psychological interventions would be crucial. The study also shows that older persons have distinct preferences for the types and contents of interventions, highlighting the need for more individualized and humanized service solutions that cater to the needs of various populations. 

 5. ConclusionsThe purpose of this study was to look at how mindfulness training and ChatGPT companionship affected depressive and lonely feelings in older persons. We discovered that, in the short term, both ChatGPT companionship and mindfulness meditation had rather limited impacts on significantly reducing depression symptoms and feelings of loneliness in older persons based on trials conducted with elderly patients in nursing homes.It is noteworthy, nevertheless, that both groups of older persons exhibited some degree of reduction in negative emotion scores, even if there was no fundamental shift in emotions. This implies that, in contrast to conventional mindfulness therapies, cutting-edge artificial intelligence-based interactive modes like ChatGPT might also be useful for reducing negative emotions and enhancing the mental health of older adults.Actually, giving older adults a technique to relax their bodies and minds and concentrate on the here and now helps them change their attention and control their emotions, which is largely why mindfulness interventions are so successful. Even though ChatGPT takes a different tack, it nonetheless gives older adults a chance to engage with the outside world by mimicking human speech. This gives them a brief break from an inactive, alone existence, which in turn promotes some level of relaxation and comfort.Thus, the results of this study offer important new information about how the new technology ChatGPT can improve older adults’ feelings.
