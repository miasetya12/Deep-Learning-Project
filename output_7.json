        "Title": "Exploring the Determinants of Chinese Tourists’ Shopping Behavior During Shopping Tourism in Korea",
        "Abstract": "AbstractThis study aimed to examine the factors influencing Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea using a theoretical framework based on the modified theory of planned behavior (TPB). A quantitative research method was used; the questionnaire for this study was posted on Wenjuanxing for data collection and 269 valid questionnaires were analyzed in September 2024 using partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of analyzing the 269 questionnaires showed that attitude, conformity, perceived behavioral control, and perceived quality of goods influenced shopping intention. However, face consciousness did not affect shopping intentions. Additionally, Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions influenced their shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea. The results of this study reveal the potential mechanisms of the influence of shopping intentions with conformity (a factor of Chinese-subjective norms) and the perceived quality of goods (a new factor) in shopping behavior, and they provide theoretical guidance and appropriate marketing strategies for companies in the Korean tourism field.Keywords:shopping behavior, modified theory of planned behavior, shopping tourism in Korea, Chinese tourists",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionDue to the rapid growth of global tourism, Chinese tourists have emerged as a significant tourist group worldwide [1]. In 2019 alone, a staggering 154.6 million Chinese citizens traveled abroad, ranking first in the world [2]. One topic of great concern is that shopping has emerged as a crucial component of Chinese outbound tourism. Shopping tourism is a form of travel where the primary goal is to purchase multiple items that are difficult to find outside their place of origin and are appealing to tourists, which means that shopping is regarded as the “primary goal” in shopping tourism [3,4]. Additionally, Li et al. based their study on the finding that for Chinese tourists visiting other countries, shopping is the most significant activity [5]. As Tsang et al. argue, Chinese tourists’ primary reason for visiting Hong Kong is shopping [6]. However, there is currently a dearth of research on Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior, and many studies concentrate on Chinese tourists’ purchases of specific goods when traveling abroad [4,7].The Korean Wave is spreading throughout Asia, including China, which is close to Korea, as well as other nations [8]. Consequently, the Korean Wave has caused an increase in the number of foreign tourists—particularly Chinese tourists—visiting Korea [9]. The number of international visitors to Korea reached its highest level in 2019 with 17,502,756 people, and Chinese tourists held the top spot with 6,709,451 people [10]. Additionally, the Korean Wave has had a significant impact on Chinese tourists’ intention to shop when visiting Korea [11]. Yoon pointed out that shopping is the main reason that Chinese tourists come to Korea [12]. On the other hand, Seo et al. emphasized the significance of Japanese tourists’ shopping behaviors while visiting Korea [13]. Nguyen et al. investigated Vietnamese tourists’ preferences for shopping tourism in Korea [14]. As a result, shopping tourism is one of the primary strategic initiatives of nations when encouraging sustainable and high-quality tourism [15]. Korea is striving hard to develop as a shopping and tourism destination that is famous worldwide [16].Although many studies have been conducted on the overseas shopping behavior of Chinese tourists, previous studies have been general and lacked specificity [17], especially since there have been relatively few in-depth investigations into Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior in Korea. The theory of planned behavior is a commonly used research method for predicting consumers’ behavioral intentions. However, whether the theory of planned behavior developed in the United States is applicable to Chinese tourists is worth further empirical research [18,19,20]. Therefore, the following research questions are posed:(1)What factors affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions while shopping in Korea?(2)Does shopping intention affect shopping behavior within the modified theory of planned behavior?To address the problems mentioned above, we constructed a conceptual model of Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior based on the modified theory of planned behavior. The conceptual model of the modified theory of planned behavior in this study replaces the subjective norms of the original theoretical model of the theory of planned behavior with Chinese-subjective norms—the face consciousness and conformity variables—and secondly, a new variable, perceived quality of goods, is added to the original model of the theory of planned behavior to form the final framework model. The hypotheses were tested by using partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), determining the influence factors of Chinese tourists’ shopping intention, better understanding Chinese tourists’ behavioral motivations for shopping tourism in Korea, enhancing the image and status of Korea on the global shopping tourism market [21], and improving the satisfaction of shopping tourism for Chinese tourists [22]. On the other hand, this study aimed to identify the factors that influence Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions while shopping in Korea, thereby determining the relationship between shopping intentions and shopping behaviors, and expanding the application areas of the modified theory of planned behavior [23]. Additionally, this study provides insight into Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea [24], and the most innovative point was the use of the modified theory of planned behavior through the PLS-SEM method, which has not been carried out in previous studies. On the other hand, some practical implications for the tourism industry, retailers, policymakers, and the design of tourism products in Korea were outlined to provide directions for improving marketing strategies or services related to Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior and boosting the Korean economy [25].Therefore, this study is organized into the following sections:Section 1introduces the status of Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior and shopping tourism in Korea, the problems in Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior and shopping tourism in Korea, and the purpose of this study.Section 2presents the research hypotheses. Furthermore, based on a literature review, the shortages and limitations in previous studies are shown.Section 3discusses the research strategy, measurement items, survey development, data collection method, and analytical methods.Section 4outlines the results.Section 5concludes by highlighting possible discussions on the outcomes and presenting some implications. 2. Literature Review2.1. Shopping TourismDue to the discovery of the connections between purchases, motivations, and the choice of destination, the topic of “shopping tourism” has recently been a hot topic in academic studies and has become more and more important in the field of tourism [26]. Shopping tourism is travel in which the primary goal is to purchase multiple items that are difficult to find outside their place of origin and are appealing to tourists [17].Moreover, Liberato et al. claimed that shopping tourism is a major economic engine for tourism and commercial growth in several nations [26]. Wijayanti et al. found that shopping tourism has become one of the most popular kinds of tourism, and it creates economic chances for locals and has a positive influence on their well-being [17,27]. On the other hand, as Tomori argues, shopping has become a more and more important part of travel and accounts for a significant amount of tourists’ expenditures [28]. This means that shopping has developed into a determining factor when selecting a travel destination and the primary purpose for traveling [26].According to Timothy’s research, shopping tourism is growing in Europe, North America, and South America, and is having a significant impact on the economy [29]. However, there are few studies on shopping tourism in Asia, especially in Korea; thus, in this study, we selected Korea as the research nation. Lee et al. investigated whether the perceived tour quality had a positive effect on tourist satisfaction in Korea [30].Additionally, Lo and Qu found that the quality of goods has a significant impact on shopping behavior, which further shows that the theory of planned behavior applies to shopping tourism [31]. Unfortunately, there is only a limited amount of research on the theory of planned behavior in the academic literature on shopping tourism. Hence, this study was based on the modified theory of planned behavior to research Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior in Korea.2.2. Modified Theory of Planned BehaviorThe theory of planned behavior is an expanded version of the theory of reasoned action [32]. However, a rising number of studies have discovered that attitude and subjective norms cannot control actual behavior, and additional influencing factors must be added to the theory of reasoned action [33]. Therefore, Ajzen formalized a theory of planned behavior by adding a new variable, perceived behavioral control, to the basic theory of reasoned action [18]. According to the definition of the theory of planned behavior, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control act together as factors of behavioral intention that affect behavior.However, Seong and Hong proposed that the theory of planned behavior needs to be expanded to increase its explanatory power [34]. Hence, many studies have used the modified theory of planned behavior, especially in the field of consumer behavior within tourism [35].2.2.1. AttitudeAjzen proposed that attitude is a behavioral or emotional tendency to respond positively or negatively to a thing, situation, feeling, idea, or person [18], meanwhile Fishbein revealed that a person’s attitude toward engaging in a certain action might be positive or negative [36]. When an activity is positively evaluated, people will wish to engage in it. In this study, attitude refers to the psychological experience or evaluation of the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists while on a shopping tour in Korea. Chinese tourists are more likely to show a positive shopping intention when they have a positive evaluation of shopping during shopping tourism in Korea. However, Bangun and Handra argued that attitude cannot influence shopping behavior directly, as it is always influenced through intention [37]. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:Hypothesis1(H1).Attitude positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.2.2.2. Subjective NormsA subjective norm is a perception or point of view about the beliefs of others that affects one’s intention to engage in a behavior or not [18]. Normative belief indicates the extent to which one is motivated to adopt the viewpoint of others in connection to the behavior that they will perform [38]. Moreover, normative belief refers to expectations that are derived from people or organizations that are viewed as influential, such as parents, partners, close friends, or others, depending on the behavior involved [18]. Chinese scholar Li et al. argued that face consciousness and conformity represent the subjective norms in Chinese culture [39]. Thereby, a suitable model for Chinese cultural characteristics appeared and was confirmed. Hence, the subjective norms of this study involved three variables of face consciousness and conformity, which represented the subjective norms of Chinese culture. Moreover, Li et al. stated that face consciousness and conformity, as subjective norms, cannot directly affect behavior [39].Zhang et al. argued that Chinese tourists often place a high value on their group’s reputation and self-worth [40]. Face consciousness is referred to as “the social anchoring of oneself in the eyes of others or groups” [41].Loss of face means losing essential social respect in one’s own eyes and others. In other words, losing one’s respectable and good social dignity in the sight of others leads to feelings of humiliation and awkwardness [42,43]. Hsu and Huang regarded face consciousness as an essential variable in understanding Chinese tourists’ consumption behavior [23]. Hence, the definition of face consciousness in this study refers to a perception of one’s own status and reputation. Measurement items of face consciousness have been adopted in prior studies, and the measurement scales were modified [38]. We present the following hypothesis:Hypothesis2-1(H2-1).Face consciousness positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.Zhou et al. argued that conformity can be defined as someone’s intention to be affected by others and has a significant impact on behavioral intentions [44]. Susilawati and Nova found that conformity is a conscious or unconscious effort to alter one’s attitudes, behaviors, or views to fit a group [45]. Hence, as Pool and Schwegler argued, people tend to look to others for guidance when faced with uncertainties, especially in China, which focuses on a harmonious culture and group orientation [46]. Accordingly, the definition of conformity in this study refers to others in the group who are also shopping, which means that if others in the group are not shopping, the subject is also not shopping, and we expect the following relationship to hold:Hypothesis2-2(H2-2).Conformity (others in the group are also shopping) positively influences shopping intentions.2.2.3. Perceived Quality of GoodsPerceived quality of goods can be defined as a consumer’s belief in the excellence of a product that is perceivable. Moreover, the perceived quality of goods is determined by the customer’s perceptions of the total experience of using that good and is not limited to the attributes of a specific one [47]. Since fake goods have flooded the domestic market in China, whenever Chinese tourists can travel abroad, they choose to buy high-quality foreign goods [48]. Therefore, it is not difficult to find that Chinese tourists are very concerned about the perceived quality of goods. Meanwhile, with the popularity of high-quality Korean goods, many fake goods posing as Korean goods are circulating in the domestic market in China. Thus, Chinese tourists are willing to buy high-quality goods when shopping in Korea. Additionally, this study, to further understand the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists when shopping in Korea, introduced a new variable—perceived quality of goods—as this can make the modified model more comprehensive and convincing [49]. On the other hand, the perceived quality of goods is a visible and tangible variable that is different from attitude and subjective norms. Therefore, based on the theoretical and empirical studies above, we expect the following relationships to hold:Hypothesis3-1(H3-1).The perceived quality of goods positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.Hypothesis3-2(H3-2).The perceived quality of goods positively influences shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea.2.2.4. Perceived Behavioral ControlThe theory of reasoned action was expanded by Ajzen to include a new construct called “perceived behavioral control” as an additional determinant of both intention and behavior [18]. It refers to the perceptions of consumers of their power to complete a given activity. Specifically, Farooq et al. stated that when an activity is viewed as being very simple to complete, there is a great likelihood that people will carry it out [50]. Hence, the definition of perceived behavioral control in this study refers to the resources, situations, and possibilities that Chinese tourists are able to perceive, as well as how easy or difficult shopping is in Korea [51]. We propose the following hypotheses:Hypothesis4-1(H4-1).Perceived behavioral control positively influences shopping intentions during shopping tourism in Korea.Hypothesis4-2(H4-2).Perceived behavioral control positively influences shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea.2.2.5. Shopping Intentions and BehaviorAzhar et al. argued that intention is a cognitive representation of one’s willingness to carry out a certain behavior, which implies that the most reliable predictor of actual behavior is intention, and an actual behavior can be realized if someone has the intention to engage in a behavior [32]. On the other hand, Brown et al. stated that consumers who express a willingness to purchase will have a greater percentage of actual purchases than consumers who express no desire to buy [52]. Moreover, Ajzen argued that intention has a significant influence on behavior [18]. Shopping intentions are defined in this study as the possibility of Chinese tourists performing a shopping behavior while shopping in Korea. Shopping behavior is defined in this study as Chinese tourists performing actual buying behavior while shopping in Korea [51]. As a result, based on the theoretical and empirical studies above, we hypothesize the following:Hypothesis5(H5).Shopping intentions positively influence shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea. 3. Methodology3.1. QuestionnaireThere were three sections to the official questionnaire. The respondents were first given a brief description of this research, and a filter question, “Do you have any travel experience in Korea?” was raised. No more questions were posed to those who answered “no”. Next, all of the measurement items for the variables in this study were obtained through a literature review. There were seven variables in this study, which were attitude (AT), face consciousness (FC), conformity (CO), perceived quality of goods (PQG), perceived behavioral control (PBC), shopping intention (SI), and shopping behavior (SB). Each variable had three measurement questions, and most of the measurement questions were used based on the previous scales in use for research and development. Depending on the circumstances, some dimensions needed to be adjusted. Meanwhile, the questionnaire was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale, where “1” meant strongly disagree, “2” meant disagree, “3” meant neutral, “4” meant agree, and “5” meant strongly agree. The 24 items in the questionnaire on the modified theory of planned behavior were based on the existing literature and were appropriately adapted to the topic of this study, as shown inTable 1. The final section investigated respondents’ backgrounds, including their gender, age, education, and monthly income. The establishment of this basic information can provide help in interpreting the results of this study.Table 1.Measurement.ConstructItemSourceAttitude (AT)I think shopping is a necessary activity when traveling in KoreaHanI think shopping is a wise choice when traveling in KoreaTaylor and ToddI think shopping is good for me when traveling in Korea[53,54]Face Consciousness (FC)While traveling in Korea, shopping can highlight my worth and positionLi et al.While traveling in Korea, shopping can make me respected by othersSomogyi et al.While traveling in Korea, shopping can allow me to gain respect[39,55]Conformity (CO)I will go shopping if most of my friends go shopping while traveling in KoreaLi et al.Maichum et al.I will follow the people with whom I am traveling in Korea to go shopping if they go shoppingI will choose the products that my traveling companions like while going shopping in Korea[39,56]Perceived Quality of Goods (PQG)When shopping in Korea, I feel that Korean goods are of good qualityErdogmus and Budeyri-TuranWhen shopping in Korea, I feel that Korean goods are reliableWhen shopping in Korea, I feel that Korean goods can be used without worryYen [49,57]Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC)It is easy to go shopping in Korea if I wantYadav and PathakNothing can stop me from shopping in Korea if I wantHanI have enough effort (time and money) to go shopping in Korea[51,53]Shopping Intention (SI)I want to go shopping if I have a chance to have a trip to KoreaLi et al.I plan to make a trip to Korea for shopping soonYenI plan to actively save money for shopping in Korea[39,49]Shopping Behavior (SB)I must go shopping during my trip to KoreaYadav and PathakI go shopping every time I travel to KoreaPerugini and BagozziEvery time I travel to Korea, I buy lots of Korean goods to take home[51,58]Open in a new tab3.2. Data CollectionThe questionnaire for this study was posted on Wenjuanxing (www.wjx.cn, accessed on 4 March 2023), which is a very popular website for designing online questionnaires in China. Since it is simpler to obtain a larger sample size and more replies, the use of online surveys in academic research has gained increasing acceptance [59]. Then, we pasted the final official questionnaire link into two instant messaging and social media applications, QQ and WeChat, which are widely used in China, and we asked users to help us collect responses. At the start of the survey on the Wenjuanxing website, we included a separate question to confirm whether respondents had traveled to Korea and shopped there within the last year. If they selected a negative option, the questionnaire was terminated. The surveys were given out starting from March 2023 to September 2024, and a total of 364 were given out. However, 95 respondents who filled out this survey in under 20 s or who checked a unified response were also disqualified, leading to the final collection of 269 valid surveys with an efficiency rate of 73.9%. Scholars recommend that when using PLS-SEM, the sample size should be at least ten times the number of measurement items across all constructs [60,61]. Accordingly, our sample size was sufficient for conducting PLS-SEM.Table 2displays the demographic characteristics.Table 2.Descriptive statistics (n= 269).ConstructItemFrequencyProportionGenderMale10037.2%Female16962.8%Age (in years)<18114.1%18–3013148.7%31–458933.1%>453814.1%EducationHigh school or below4516.7%Diploma3211.9%Bachelor’s degree10840.1%Master’s degree or above5821.6%Others269.7%Monthly income (CNY/Yuan)3000 or less7427.5%3001–50007929.4%5001–10,0006825.3%10,001 or more4817.8%Open in a new tab3.3. Data Analysis and TechniquesPartial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is appropriate for exploratory relationship analysis [60,62]. It is an effective method for examining diverse data structures [62]. Studies in the tourism field have applied PLS-SEM in various contexts, including museum marketing [63,64]. Therefore, SPSS v28 was adopted to screen and manage raw data and present the descriptive statistics first. Next, PLS-SEM analysis was conducted in two phases through SmartPLS 4.0: measurement model assessment and structural model assessment [65]. The path coefficient significance was tested using the PLS algorithm and bootstrapping with 5000 subsamples.Figure 1shows the results of the structural model analysis.Figure 1.Open in a new tabThe estimated structural model. 4. Results4.1. Measurement Model AssessmentFirst, an analysis of the partial least-squares structural equation modeling algorithm was used to test the validity and reliability of the measurement model. AsTable 3shows, each item’s loading values were higher than 0.7 (loadings ranging from 0.834 to 0.924), which proved that all items were significantly loaded, and their indicator reliability was verified [60,65].Table 3.Reliability and validity analysis.ConstructItemFactorLoadingsCronbach’s AlphaCRAverageVarianceExtractedAttitude (AT)AT10.8910.8930.8950.824AT20.924AT30.908Face Consciousness (FC)FC10.9010.8790.8820.804FC20.888FC30.902Conformity (CO)CO10.8610.8060.8070.721CO20.834CO30.852Perceived Quality of Goods (PQG)PQG10.8790.8760.8780.801PQG20.901PQG30.905Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC)PBC10.8960.8590.8590.780PBC20.889PBC30.864Shopping Intention (SI)SI10.8730.8650.8650.787SI20.897SI30.891Shopping Behavior (SB)SB10.8830.8780.8780.803SB20.906SB30.900Open in a new tabInternal consistency/reliability can be measured in two ways: composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach’s alpha (α). When the value of Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability for each item is over 0.7, the internal consistency/reliability of each latent variable can be proved [62,65].Table 3shows that Cronbach’s alpha values ranged from 0.806 to 0.893, and the composite reliability values ranged from 0.807 to 0.895.Then, an evaluation of validity was performed through convergent validity and discriminant validity [65]. According to Hair et al., the average variance extracted (AVE) can be considered a measurement of convergent validity, and each value of the AVE should be over 0.5 [62,66]. As can be seen inTable 3, all latent variables’ AVE values were over 0.7, which indicated good convergent validity.Next, the discriminant validity was determined by using the Fornell and Larcker criteria [62,67]. AsTable 4shows, all variables’ diagonal values (the square root of the AVE) exceeded the values of any other latent variables underneath them (AT = 0.908, FC = 0.897, CO = 0.849, PQG = 0.895, PBC = 0.883, SI = 0.887, SB = 0.896). Hence, the results conformed to the Fornell and Larcker criteria, and indicated adequate discriminant validity. As a result, the reliability and validity of the measurement model in this study were satisfactory.Table 4.Discriminant validity (Fornell).ATFCCOPQGPBCSISBAT0.908FC0.6460.897CO0.7530.6460.849PQG0.7380.6760.6650.895PBC0.7630.5580.6870.7020.883SI0.7880.5990.7340.7390.7320.887SB0.8300.6120.8060.7190.7660.8360.896Open in a new tab4.2. Structural Model AssessmentThe structural model in this study was assessed through the path coefficients R2(coefficient of determination) and Q2(PLS Predict) [62]. The collinearity assessment in this study was conducted using the variance inflation factor (VIF) before the structural model assessment. As Hair et al. argued, if the value of the VIF is high, the level of collinearity will be higher, which may cause a multicollinearity problem and make the model unreliable [65]. Therefore, when the value of the VIF is ≥5, a collinearity issue may arise. The values of the VIF in this study were all equal to or less than 3.058, which indicated that the model in this study was acceptable and had no collinearity issues.Afterward, the coefficient of determination (R2) was evaluated. R2refers to the explanatory power for all independent constructs [65]. Additionally, as Cohen argued, a value of R2over 0.26 indicates that the explanatory power is substantial [68]. Consequently, the values of R2for shopping intention and shopping behavior were 0.713 and 0.756, respectively, while the values of Q2were 0.697 and 0.729, respectively, indicating the sufficient explanatory power and predictive accuracy of the structural model (Table 5). Meanwhile, Cohen presented a value of f2over 0.35 as an indication of a high effect [68].Table 6shows that the highest f2value of 0.426 was observed in the relationship between shopping intention and shopping behavior, which indicated a high impact, and the lowest f2value of 0.023 was observed in the relationship between perceived quality of goods and shopping behavior.Table 5.Coefficient determination.ConstructR2Adj.

As a result, the structural model in this study had a favorable model fit. In summary, the structural model in this study had no collinearity problems and had sufficient explanatory power and predictive accuracy.4.3. Hypothesis TestingTo determine the significance of the path coefficients, a bootstrapping approach for PLS-SEM was used [65]. The results obtained after running the bootstrap routine are presented inTable 6. There was a significant relationship between the measured and latent variables when the t-value was >1.96 (p< 0.005) at the 95% confidence level (α = 0.05). Conversely, when the t-value was <1.96, there was no relationship between the measured and latent variables. The results showed that attitude (H1: β = 0.316, t = 3.975,p= 0.000), conformity (H2-2: β = 0.221, t = 3.093,p= 0.002), the perceived quality of goods (H3-1: β = 0.243, t = 3.727,p= 0.000), and perceived behavioral control (H4–1: β = 0.174, t = 2.791,p= 0.005) had positive relationships with shopping intention. Moreover, the perceived quality of goods (H3-2: β = 0.119, t = 2.098,p= 0.036) and perceived behavioral control (H4-2: β = 0.291, t = 4.931,p= 0.000) had relationships with shopping behavior. Furthermore, shopping intention (H5: β = 0.534, t = 7.906,p= 0.000) also had a significant effect on shopping behavior. Therefore, H1, H2-2, H3-1, H3-2, H4-1, H4-2, and H5 were supported. However, face consciousness (H2-1: β = −0.009, t = 0.172,p= 0.864) had no relationships with shopping intention because the t-values of the observed variables were all smaller than 1.96. Meanwhile, the number 0 was contained in the interval of BCI-LL and BCI-UL. Hence, H2-1 was rejected. 5. Discussion and Implications5.1. DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to investigate which variables affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions while shopping in Korea. Specifically, there are four determinants that can affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions which are attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control. However, this study found that face consciousness failed to have an influence on Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions.Attitude positively affects Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. This suggests that a positive attitude toward shopping tourism will positively influence Chinese tourists’ shopping intention for shopping in Korea. This is consistent with previous findings that positive attitudes increase consumer purchase intentions [70]. Additionally, Chinese tourists feel that shopping tourism in Korea is a wise and essential decision, and Chinese tourists are eager to shop during shopping tourism in Korea. The data also imply that Chinese tourists who have a positive attitude toward shopping tourism are more likely to decide whether they are willing to shop. Therefore, the findings reinforce the original theory of planned behavior [70,71].Conformity positively affects Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. This suggests that conformity to Chinese-subjective norms will positively influence Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions for shopping in Korea. This is consistent with the claim by Kai et al. that conformity has an important role in shopping intentions, and conformity affects Chinese seniors’ purchase intentions [72]. Meanwhile, this suggests that conformity with Chinese-subjective norms is an important factor influencing Chinese tourists’ willingness to shop, and it provides an important value for local Korean companies in developing shopping tourism marketing programs. Additionally, the data imply that Chinese tourists are willing to shop in Korea while following the relatives or friends surrounding them. Therefore, more attention should be paid to conformity with Chinese-subjective norms when conducting research on the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists in the future. However, Jin and Kang claimed that Chinese consumers’ conformity did not affect purchase intentions toward a US apparel brand, which was inconsistent with our findings. A very important point to note is that their study selected Chinese consumers living in economically developed areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc., whereas the selection of regions for this study included tourists from all regions of China, so the selection was broader and more representative. However, this provides a new direction for our future research on whether these findings are applicable in economically developed cities in China [73]. However, the Chinese-subjective norm of face consciousness did not affect the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. Outbound tourism is becoming more frequent and convenient in China. Moreover, shopping in Korea has become a common behavior for Chinese tourists. Chinese tourists feel that shopping in Korea does not highlight their worth and position [12]. This suggests that local Korean companies do not need to deliberately focus on the variable of face consciousness when marketing or designing tourism products, but they should rather design tourism products that are more suited to the needs of Chinese tourists.The perceived quality of goods significantly influences Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions and behavior. This suggests that high-quality goods will positively affect Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions in Korea. At the same time, high-quality items can also directly influence the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. These data also imply that high-quality goods in Korea are distinctively different from goods made in China, thus frequently attracting the interest of Chinese tourists and increasing their shopping intentions [4]. Hence, Chinese tourists are willing to shop in Korea directly due to the high quality of the goods, and the perceived quality of goods is an extension of the original theory of planned behavior [74].Perceived behavioral control positively affects Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions and behavior. Qin and Lee argued that it is very convenient for Chinese tourists to shop in Korea, and if they have enough resources (time and funding), they are willing to shop in Korea [75]. This suggests that Korean tourism companies should actively pay attention to providing a good shopping atmosphere to attract Chinese tourists. Additionally, a convenient shopping environment is more attractive to Chinese tourists. Meanwhile, Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions significantly influence their shopping behavior, which is in line with prior studies [76]. The data also imply that positive shopping intentions can greatly boost Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior. These findings highlight the importance of the modified theory of planned behavior for Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior.5.2. Implications5.2.1. Theoretical ImplicationsThis study offers precious contributions to the existing literature, specifically for the modified theory of planned behavior. The first purpose was to investigate the impacts of attitude, face consciousness, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control on shopping intentions.The results of this study showed relationships between attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, which were consistent with previous theories [77]. Therefore, this result reinforces the existing TPB. Moreover, the findings from this study enhance the understanding of Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior during shopping tourism in Korea [4]. This study also shows that the perceived quality of goods is an important influencing factor for Chinese tourists in improving their shopping behavior during their shopping tourism in Korea [78]. The findings also broaden the current literature on the TPB and strengthen the existing TPB. Although previous studies on shopping behavior mainly focused on Western countries, the findings from this study suggest that the TPB is also suitable for Chinese tourists [71,79].Lastly, the findings affirmed the reliability and validity of the indicators of attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, perceived behavioral control, and intentions. These indicators have implications for the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. At the same time, these indicators were verified as robust based on existing theories and exhibited statistical significance. Furthermore, these indicators can also provide a solid foundation for future development of the modified TPB [80].5.2.2. Practical ImplicationsWith the rapid development of shopping tourism in Korea, more and more Chinese tourists choose to go to Korea for shopping tourism. Hence, tourism enterprises need to pay more attention to the aspects of attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control of Chinese tourists to attract more of them. The findings from this study have some practical implications for tourism enterprises trying to attract Chinese tourists. Specifically, they are reflected in the following aspects.First, a positive attitude has a significant impact on Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. Therefore, tourism enterprises should establish a positive brand image and make efforts to form positive attitude for potential Chinese tourists to gain a good impression through word of mouth [81].Second, the Korean government improves the perceived behavioral control of Chinese tourists and increases their shopping behavior by reducing shopping tourism costs and increasing the value perceived by Chinese tourists during shopping tourism in Korea [82].Third, the perceived quality of goods is an important influencing factor for Chinese tourists’ shopping behavior. High-quality Korean goods are more appealing to Chinese tourists, thus increasing their shopping intentions; therefore, enterprises should design high-quality and well-crafted tourism goods according to Chinese preferences [83].Fourth, Chinese tourists hold the view that face consciousness would not improve their shopping intentions. However, conformity is popular in China; Chinese tourists like to follow the actions of the surrounding people or things [84]. Hence, conformity is an important factor in Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. Korean tourism companies should develop appropriate marketing strategies to attract Chinese tourists based on conformity.Lastly, in order to promote the global tourism industry after the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government has launched a permanent visa-free policy with Thailand for ordinary citizens, which facilitates the economic and tourism exchange between the two countries. On the other hand, the Chinese government has implemented short-term visa-free access to Singapore and Malaysia. China has actively created mutual visa-free policies for ordinary citizens of Southeast Asian countries, which shows that China vigorously encourages Chinese people to travel abroad, which will promote the recovery and development of other countries’ economies and tourism. At the same time, China also hopes that the citizens of other countries will travel to China. Many cities in China have implemented visa-free policies for foreigners with 72 or 114 h of transit in order to help China’s economy, the world’s economy, and the tourism market recover. The Chinese government is also continuing to launch a series of favorable policies [85]. Therefore, the Korean government should seize this opportunity to keep attracting Chinese tourists to Korea, and local Korean companies should develop appropriate marketing strategies for Chinese tourists. 6. Conclusions, Limitations, and Future ResearchThis study investigated the factors affecting shopping behavior among Chinese tourists during shopping tourism in Korea. The key findings include the significant impact of attitude, conformity, perceived quality of goods, and perceived behavioral control on shopping intentions, whereas face consciousness did not significantly affect shopping intentions. Furthermore, shopping intentions positively drove shopping behavior.Despite its contributions, this study has several limitations that need to be noted when interpreting the findings.First, most of the scale measures utilized in the questionnaire for this study were taken from well-known Western scales, but there was a lack of scales based on the Chinese cultural background in prior literature. Future studies can design more reasonable questionnaire items for the shopping behavior of Chinese tourists. Additionally, experts’ opinions can be sought when designing measurement items to ensure, as much as possible, the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the measurement items.Second, there are still many factors affecting Chinese tourists’ shopping intentions. In the future, we can think about adding control variables to group Chinese tourists for more in-depth research; for example, we can study whether gender affects shopping intentions and whether there are differences in shopping intentions between young people and older people. In other words, a thorough, in-depth investigation can improve the research model’s accuracy and dependability.Third, according to the data collected of this study, the target demographic was relatively young people (18–45 years old), making up 81.8% of the sample. The proportion of the elderly was not high, so the results of this study and whether it is representative of the elderly group need to be further verified. Hence, we can consider expanding the method of questionnaire distribution, such as through the use of offline questionnaires, which would be more targeted and allow for a more effective control of the number of young people versus old people. Another option is to work with travel agencies to distribute the questionnaire, which can save time and guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and extensiveness of the data."

        "Title": "Determinants Associated with COVID-19 Vaccination among Korean Adults: Based on Andersen’s Model",
        "Abstract": "AbstractCOVID-19 vaccination is a critical public health measure to control the pandemic, but disparities in vaccination uptake remain a concern. This study investigates the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination among Korean adults using the Andersen model. Data from 231,784 participants in the community health survey were analyzed using chi-square testing and logistic regression. The risk of non-vaccination was higher among those aged 19–64 (95% CI: 1.52–1.74), males (95% CI: 1.11–1.24), the unemployed (95% CI: 2.21–2.47), unmarried individuals (95% CI: 1.12–1.24), those with unmet healthcare needs (95% CI: 1.41–1.67), recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees (95% CI: 1.45–1.73), those with lower subjective health (95% CI: 1.20–1.30), individuals with depression (95% CI: 1.28–1.44), current smokers (95% CI: 1.13–1.30), and those skipping breakfast (95% CI: 1.04–1.16). Conversely, the risk was lower for those with less than a high school education (95% CI: 0.72–0.81), individuals with psychological concerns about infection (0.87, 95% CI: 0.82–0.92) or public criticism (0.91, 95% CI: 0.86–0.97), individuals with chronic diseases (95% CI: 0.64–0.72), and current alcohol consumers (95% CI: 0.52–0.58). These findings underscore the need for targeted intervention strategies and support systems to promote vaccination in vulnerable populations. Further research should explore the long-term impact of these interventions on vaccination uptake.Keywords:COVID-19, adolescent, vaccination, Andersen model",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionThe onset of COVID-19 in January 2020 heralded an unparalleled global health crisis, leading to widespread fatalities and significant lifestyle changes. The virus’s highly contagious nature, coupled with the emergence of mutated strains, continues to pose concerns about sustained transmission and enduring societal impacts [1]. Despite global vaccination efforts, COVID-19 remains a substantial challenge. Vaccination is pivotal not only for preventing infection but also for reducing the severity and risk of death from the virus [2]. While surpassing the World Health Organization’s vaccination target, there is an ongoing need to investigate factors influencing vaccination rates, particularly among the unvaccinated population [3]. As new infectious diseases persist, research becomes crucial to enhance community vaccination rates.Prior studies have applied Andersen’s Model to discern factors affecting vaccination intentions [4]. The Andersen model, designed to predict individual use of medical services, categorizes factors into predisposing, enabling, and need factors [5]. Predisposing factors encompass demographic and sociological characteristics, enabling factors to cover aspects influencing the ability to use medical services and need factors pertaining to physical and mental health challenges [5].In a study examining college students’ COVID-19 vaccination intentions applying the Andersen model, factors such as demographic characteristics, the influence of peers, psychological predispositions, the acquisition of COVID-19 vaccine information, vaccine literacy, health status, and COVID-19-related experiences were considered [3]. Psychological predisposition significantly influenced college students’ COVID-19 vaccination intentions [3]. International studies have indicated lower vaccination intentions among women, younger individuals, those with lower education, and individuals in non-medical majors and occupations [6,7]. A prior investigation into factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination status among the elderly in China revealed that women, unmarried individuals, urban residents, and those with chronic diseases are less likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [8].Despite numerous studies on COVID-19 in Korea focusing on epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccination intentions for specific groups, there is a scarcity of research identifying factors related to the actual vaccination of the entire Korean population. This study aims to fill this gap by applying the Andersen model to national-scale survey data, seeking to uncover factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination and contribute to the development of community programs aimed at improving vaccination rates. Additionally, it is important to address factors such as concerns about side effects, confidence in vaccine effectiveness, influence from peers and family, and policies regarding free vaccine provision to ensure a comprehensive understanding of vaccination behaviors and hesitancy.Anderson ModelThe Andersen model, widely used in healthcare access studies, was selected for this research because it offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the multi-dimensional factors that influence health behaviors, such as COVID-19 vaccination. The model divides these factors into three categories: predisposing factors (e.g., demographic and psychological characteristics), enabling factors (e.g., resources or barriers to care), and need factors (e.g., health status and perceived need for care). These categories align well with the determinants explored in this study. Previous research has demonstrated the Andersen model’s effectiveness in examining vaccination behavior, particularly in understanding how individual characteristics, access to healthcare, and perceived needs influence vaccination decisions. By utilizing this model, we aim to identify the various factors that contribute to COVID-19 vaccination uptake among Korean adults. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Data and SampleThis study utilized primary data from the 2022 Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS) conducted by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency between 16 August and 31 October 2022. The KCHS is an annual cross-sectional survey that employs a multistage, stratified area probability sampling method to select participants from civilian, non-institutionalized Korean households. Sampling is based on geographic area, age, and sex, ensuring representative data across different demographic groups. Data collection was performed through one-on-one in-person interviews using standardized questionnaires administered by trained surveyors.For the purposes of this study, participants who reported receiving a COVID-19 vaccination were initially considered. However, individuals who reported being unvaccinated were excluded from the final analysis. After applying these exclusion criteria, a total of 231,784 individuals were retained in the final dataset.2.2. Measurement2.2.1. Predisposing FactorPredisposing factors refer to the demographic and psychological characteristics of individuals that may influence health behavior. In this study, age was categorized into two groups: 19–64 and 65 or older. Gender was classified as either male or female. Job status was divided into those with an occupation and those without. Spouse status was categorized based on whether participants had a spouse or not, including those who were never married, divorced, or widowed. Education level was classified as either below high school graduate or college and above. Lastly, psychological concerns related to COVID-19 were measured by asking participants to rate their level of concern in three specific areas: (1) concern about infection, (2) concern about public criticism, and (3) concern about economic damage.In this study, psychological concerns related to COVID-19, such as fear of infection and economic anxiety, were considered part of predisposing factors. This is in line with the Andersen model, which allows for psychological characteristics to be included as individual-level factors influencing health behavior. Although these factors could also be viewed sociologically, they are incorporated here as predisposing influences based on individual perceptions and experiences.2.2.2. Enabling FactorsEnabling factors refer to conditions that either facilitate or hinder access to healthcare services. In this study, unmet healthcare needs were assessed by asking participants, “Over the past year, have you ever felt that you could not or did not access medical services when needed?” Responses were categorized as either “Yes” or “No”. The status of being a recipient of the national basic livelihood guarantee, a form of government-provided social assistance, was also considered. Additionally, region of residence was categorized based on participants’ living locations, grouped as either urban or rural areas.2.2.3. Need FactorsNeed factors most directly reflect access to medical care by highlighting disease characteristics. In this study, subjective health, stress, depression, chronic diseases, current smoking, current alcohol drinking, and eating breakfast were included. Subjective health was categorized as “very bad, bad, normal, good, and very good” and later reclassified as “above good” and “below normal”. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), recommended with a cutoff score of 5 [9] (Park et al., 2010). Chronic diseases included diagnosed hypertension and diabetes. Current smoking was determined by the question: “Do you smoke now?” Current alcohol drinking refers to those who consumed alcohol within the past month.2.3. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were presented as proportions and compared using chi-square tests to identify differences between groups. Binary logistic regression was used as the outcome variable (vaccination status), which was dichotomous.Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Univariate logistic regression was first employed to assess the crude relationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable (COVID-19 vaccination status). This step allowed us to identify the raw associations without adjusting for potential confounders.Following the univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding variables and determine the independent effects of each predictor on vaccination status. Variables that were significant in the univariate analysis (p< 0.05) were included in the multivariate model. The results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. 3. ResultsThe outcomes presented inTable 1illustrate an analysis of COVID-19 vaccination patterns concerning predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Among the participants, 3.4% reported being unvaccinated. The frequencies and percentage distributions of each categorical variable related to COVID-19 vaccination were derived using the χ2test. Non-vaccination rates were notably elevated among individuals aged 19–64 (71.4%), females (56.1%), those without an occupation (55.5%), individuals without a spouse (42.9%), those with education below the high school level (55.4%), individuals with psychological concerns about COVID-19 infection (60.3%) and economic repercussions (50.6%), those lacking psychological concerns about COVID-19 public criticism (55.5%), individuals with experienced unmet healthcare needs (9.6%), recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees (9.5%), urban residents (60.9%), individuals reporting higher subjective health (35.2%), those experiencing stress (74.8%), individuals with depression (24.8%), those without chronic diseases (73.3%), individuals who currently smoke (18.2%), those not currently drinking alcohol (73.3%), and those not having breakfast (60.4%).Table 1.General characteristics of COVID-19 vaccination.VariableTotal %Unvaccinated %Vaccinated %pPredisposing factorsAge19–6465.771.465.5<0.001≥6534.328.634.5GenderMale45.843.945.8<0.001Female54.256.154.2Job statusInoccupation37.255.536.5<0.001Occupation62.844.563.5SpouseAbsence34.142.933.8<0.001Existence65.957.166.2Education≤High school61.155.461.3<0.001>College38.944.638.7Psychological concerns of COVID-19InfectionYes64.560.364.7<0.001No35.339.735.3Public criticismYes49.544.549.7<0.001No50.555.550.3Economic damageYes54.150.654.2<0.001No45.949.445.8Enabling factorsUnmet healthcare needYes5.89.65.7<0.001No94.290.494.3Recipient of national basic livelihood guaranteesYes4.59.54.3<0.001No95.590.585.7Region of residenceRural43.539.143.6<0.001Urban56.560.956.4Need factorsSubjective healthBelow normal59.864.859.6<0.001Above good40.235.240.4StressYes73.874.873.70.037No26.225.226.3DepressionYes16.824.816.5<0.001No83.275.283.5Chronic diseaseYes35.326.735.6<0.001No64.773.364.4Current smokingYes16.418.216.3<0.001No83.681.883.7Current alcohol drinkingYes47.035.147.4<0.001No53.064.952.6Eating breakfastYes33.939.633.7<0.001No66.160.466.3Open in a new tabLogistic regression analyses were employed to assess the impact of predisposing, enabling, and need factors on COVID-19 vaccination (Table 2).

Males had 1.08 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.03–1.13) compared to females (reference group). Individuals without an occupation had 0.46 times lower odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 0.44–0.48), with those in an occupation serving as the reference group. The odds of non-vaccination were also 1.47 times higher for individuals without a spouse (95% CI: 1.40–1.54) compared to those with a spouse (reference group). Moreover, individuals with a high school education or lower had 1.28 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.22–1.34) compared to those with a college degree or higher (reference group). Furthermore, psychological concerns, such as fear of COVID-19 infection, were associated with a 1.21 times increase in the odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.15–1.26) compared to those without such concerns.In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for all variables, the risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination increased by 1.63 times for individuals aged 19–64 (95% CI: 1.52–1.74) compared to those aged 65 or older (reference group). Males had 1.17 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.11–1.24) compared to females (reference group). Individuals not in occupation had 2.34 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 2.21–2.47) compared to those with an occupation (reference group). The risk of non-vaccination was also 1.18 times higher for individuals without a spouse (95% CI: 1.12–1.24) compared to those with a spouse (reference group). In contrast, individuals with a high school education or lower had 24% lower odds of non-vaccination (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72–0.81) compared to those with a college degree or higher (reference group). Notably, psychological concerns, such as fear of COVID-19 infection, decreased the odds of non-vaccination by 13% (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82–0.92) compared to individuals without such concerns, while public criticism similarly reduced the odds by 9% (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86–0.97).In terms of enabling factors, individuals with unmet healthcare needs had 1.54 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.41–1.67) compared to those without unmet healthcare needs (reference group). Similarly, recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees had 1.59 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.45–1.73) compared to non-recipients (reference group).Regarding need factors, the risk of non-vaccination was 1.27 times higher for individuals with lower subjective health (95% CI: 1.20–1.30) compared to those reporting good health (reference group). Individuals with depression had 1.36 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.28–1.44) compared to those without depression (reference group). Current smokers had 1.21 times higher odds of non-vaccination (95% CI: 1.13–1.30) compared to non-smokers (reference group), while not eating breakfast increased the odds of non-vaccination by 1.10 times (95% CI: 1.04–1.16) compared to those who ate breakfast regularly (reference group). Conversely, individuals with chronic diseases had 32% lower odds of non-vaccination (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.64–0.72) compared to those without chronic diseases (reference group), and those who consumed alcohol had 45% lower odds of non-vaccination (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.52–0.58) compared to non-drinkers (reference group). 4. DiscussionThis study examines the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination in South Korea using data from the 2022 Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS). Given that vaccination is one of the most cost-effective measures during public health crises, the Andersen model was employed to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the factors influencing vaccination decisions. The findings are consistent with previous studies while also revealing new insights into vaccination behavior in South Korea.Predisposing factors, such as age, gender, job status, marital status, education level, and psychological concerns about COVID-19, significantly impact COVID-19 vaccination. Individuals over 65, females, those employed, and those with spouses exhibited a lower risk of being unvaccinated, aligning with previous findings [10,11]. This trend could be attributed to the national vaccination program’s focus on individuals aged 65 and older, which successfully increased vaccination rates in this group. Interestingly, individuals with higher education (college level and above) showed a greater risk of being unvaccinated. This result contradicts some prior findings [11], suggesting that more research is needed to explore the influence of education on vaccine hesitancy. Psychological concerns related to COVID-19 underscore the need for psychological support programs, considering the psychological impact on the vaccination group. In preparing COVID-19 countermeasures, addressing psychological and social aspects, tailored to the varying levels of psychological concern, is imperative. Effective intervention and support systems are vital as community residents’ psychological concerns can influence their health and behavior [12]. Tailored psychological support and information campaigns should address these concerns to improve vaccination rates [13].Enabling factors like unmet healthcare needs and recipients of national basic livelihood guarantees were associated with higher risks of being unvaccinated. These findings underscore the necessity of targeted interventions for socially vulnerable populations, such as economically disadvantaged groups, who may face barriers to accessing healthcare [11]. Providing reliable information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, coupled with support systems, could improve vaccination coverage in these communities. Social distancing measures and the pandemic’s broader social impacts have further exacerbated the challenges for these populations [14].Need factors, including subjective health, depression, current smoking, and skipping breakfast, were also associated with a higher risk of being unvaccinated. People reporting poor subjective health or depression often display vaccine hesitancy [15], necessitating motivational and educational programs [16]. The association between smoking and vaccine distrust reflects the need for targeted interventions aimed at smokers [17], as smoking may contribute to vaccine hesitancy [18]. Skipping breakfast, often linked to poor nutrition, could impair immune function [19] and thus influence attitudes toward vaccination [20]. Interestingly, those with chronic diseases were less likely to be unvaccinated, suggesting that they understand the preventive benefits of vaccination, which is consistent with previous studies [21]. However, the lower risk of being unvaccinated among current drinkers contradicted earlier research [22], highlighting the need for further investigation.4.1. Strengths and LimitationsThis study benefits from the use of a large, nationally representative dataset, enhancing the generalizability of its findings. The application of the Andersen model also allows for a structured analysis of factors influencing vaccination behavior. However, a limitation is the absence of cognitive factors, such as knowledge and attitudes, which could further explain vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and more information becomes available, public perceptions of vaccines may change, which this study could not account for. Future research should include longitudinal data to capture these shifts.4.2. Implications for Policy and PracticeThe findings from this study highlight several areas for future action. First, psychological concerns and barriers to healthcare access must be addressed through targeted intervention strategies, particularly for economically vulnerable populations. Educational campaigns should focus on debunking myths about vaccines and promoting the benefits of vaccination, particularly among those with higher education and those who engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking. Public health strategies should also integrate tailored support for individuals with poor mental health and unmet healthcare needs, which could improve overall vaccination rates. 5. ConclusionsThis study identified key determinants of COVID-19 vaccination among Korean adults using the Andersen model. Gender, age, education level, job status, marital status, psychological concerns about COVID-19, healthcare access, unmet healthcare needs, mental health conditions, and health behaviors all significantly shaped vaccination patterns. The findings suggest that public health authorities should focus on disseminating reliable information about vaccines, especially to economically disadvantaged individuals and those with poor mental or physical health. Tailored intervention strategies are necessary to actively promote vaccination uptake, particularly among socially vulnerable groups. In future research, longitudinal studies will be essential to monitor changes in vaccine perceptions and behaviors as the pandemic and vaccination campaigns evolve. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on COVID-19 vaccination and provides a solid foundation for designing educational and policy interventions to increase vaccination rates."

        "Abstract": "AbstractTo improve older adults’ mental health, this study compared the effects of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT 3.0, with traditional mindfulness therapies on loneliness and depression in older adults. Despite interest in AI as a complementary tool, empirical evidence on its impact remains limited. For an eight-week intervention, older adult participants from two nursing homes in Hangzhou were assigned to groups focused on mindfulness (group sessions) and chatting (one-on-one ChatGPT). Following the intervention, participants engaged in a researcher-led focus group discussion. After 8 weeks, tension had decreased significantly (p< 0.05) in the Mindfulness group of older adults, and there was no significant difference between the effects of ChatGPT and mindfulness on the emotional intervention of older adults. Findings indicated three themes, including (1) personal experience, reflecting older adults’ use of AI technology and mindfulness; (2) attitudes and perspectives on the experiment’s desirability and insufficiencies; and (3) needs and expectations for future AI and mindfulness developments, including usability and functional preferences. Similar to mindfulness practice, ChatGPT interactions helped older adults feel less depressed and might eventually reduce costs by replacing mindfulness. In the future, AI can be integrated with conventional techniques to improve interaction by giving AI a more human-like appearance.Keywords:artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, mindfulness practice, older adults, negative emotions, life satisfaction",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionGlobal aging and technological advancements have prompted researchers to explore how technology can support aging populations and enhance older adults’ well-being. The increasing prevalence of empty nesters, driven by demographic shifts and adult children’s independent living, has become a focal point of public interest. Empty-nested older adult people are those who do not have children living with them, which includes both those who do not have children and those who live separately from their children [1]. In comparison to non-empty nesters, empty nesters experience a markedly greater sense of loneliness and exhibit a complicated range of psychological reactions [2]. According to an Indian study, people who are empty nesters tend to have higher depression symptoms [3]. According to a study on the mental health of older adults in China, over 34% of survey participants displayed depressive symptoms [4]. The causes of negative emotions among older adults are varied, including their own physical health [5], social support [6], economic status [7], and living environment [8].Loneliness is a prevalent emotional distress among empty nesters [9,10], with one study reporting a mean loneliness score of 42.84 [11]. Loneliness occurs when an individual’s social expectations mismatch with their current situation [12]. The UCLA Loneliness Scale quantifies individual loneliness, with higher scores denoting greater loneliness. Loneliness in older adults is influenced by multiple factors, encompassing sociodemographic, physical, psychological, and cultural aspects, as well as social support [13]. Older adults who live in the outer suburbs are more likely to report loneliness than those who live in the city center. Older adults who live alone are more lonely than those who do not. Older adults with less education report being lonely more often than those with more. People with lower socioeconomic status reported more loneliness than older adults with higher socioeconomic status [14]. Physical pain and chronic illnesses exacerbate loneliness [15]. Insufficient social support correlates with loneliness [16], while social contact enhances mental health [17]. Loneliness can lead to negative consequences for older adults [18], including physical illness, depression, and suicide. It significantly lowers the quality of life and impairs social functioning in older persons who often lack coping mechanisms [19].Studies indicate a high prevalence of depression among older adults [20], ranging from 28.5% to 28.8% [21]. These findings imply that depressive mood is a common issue among older adults. Depression is a negative emotional experience dominated by low mood [22] and is a common adverse emotion in the older adult population [23]. The presence of depressive symptoms in older adults can be measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15). Many different and intricate elements can contribute to depression in older adults. Multiple factors contribute to depression in older adults, including lack of companionship in empty nesters [24], advanced age, marital status, poor finances, sleep quality, chronic diseases, and living conditions [25]. Sedentary lifestyles [26] and limited social participation [27] also correlate with increased depressive symptoms. Depressed mood can significantly impact older adults’ physical and mental health, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions [28]. It may disrupt sleep patterns [29], negatively affect physical health perceptions [30], and impair social functioning and quality of life [31].Interventions for mood disorders in older adults include pharmacological treatments, psychotherapy, physical activity, social support, cognitive training, mindfulness practices, and chat-based care. For severe mood disorders like depression, medication is commonly prescribed to older adult patients. Various antidepressants are commonly used to treat geriatric depression [32]. In addition to medication, psychological intervention is also one of the most important means of treating geriatric depression. When used in conjunction with medication, psychological therapies can significantly improve the quality of life for older adults people suffering from depression [33]. Psychological relief therapy lowers sadness and anxiety by assisting patients in understanding and addressing the feelings and thought processes that contribute to depression [34]. In conclusion, psychological intervention and other non-drug therapies can be added to the medication regimen for older adult patients experiencing loneliness and depression in order to enhance both the therapeutic outcome and the patient’s quality of life. The medication regimen should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient and take into account their unique circumstances.The improvement strategy for older persons experiencing depressive symptoms without a particular diagnosis should include social support, non-pharmacological therapy, emotional control techniques, and telemedicine care. Research has demonstrated that cognitive reappraisal techniques, which entail modifying one’s interpretation of occurrences and, as a result, the emotional reaction, can successfully lessen depressed symptoms [35]. Family support, hobbies, and physical activity are forms of social support associated with reducing depressive symptoms [25]. Individual nostalgia therapy can alleviate depression and reduce loneliness in geriatric internal medicine patients [36].Mindfulness-based therapy is an intervention that has proven to be effective [37]. Mindfulness refers to a process that cultivates a state of mind characterized by non-judgmental awareness of the present moment, including one’s feelings, thoughts, bodily sensations, consciousness, and environment, while promoting openness, curiosity, and acceptance [38]. The fundamental premise of mindfulness practice is that experiencing the present moment without judgment and with openness can effectively counteract the effects of stressful stimuli [39]. Baer suggests that mindfulness therapy may be beneficial in treating anxiety and mood disorders [40]. Research indicates that mindfulness therapy is particularly effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals with mood disorders, surpassing the placebo effect significantly [37]. In one systematic review, seven out of nine studies concluded that mindfulness therapy was advantageous for older adults experiencing anxiety or depression [41]. Another study found mindfulness therapy to be an acceptable approach for alleviating depressive symptoms in individuals aged 65 and older [42]. Therefore, this study will incorporate mindfulness as one of the interventions to enhance mood in older adults.Chat nursing, a model well-suited to older adult patients’ characteristics, effectively alleviates depression among elderly inpatients [43] and plays an irreplaceable role in humanizing their care [44]. Traditional chat care, while providing timely feedback and emotional support, faces practical limitations such as labor costs and geographic constraints. Technology-based chatting offers a viable alternative. Smartphone apps and online platforms can overcome these limitations, enhancing flexibility and convenience in caregiver-older adult communication [45]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) develops computational systems that simulate human intelligence tasks. Generative AI, a subset relying on machine learning and deep learning, includes ChatGPT. This AI-powered chatbot provides tailored, intelligent conversational experiences by generating responses based on user input [46]. As a dialogue-based AI model, ChatGPT offers personalized, specialized, and real-time health information and support, surpassing traditional chat care. This is especially vital for older adults requiring close health monitoring [47]. ChatGPT offers unrestricted companionship for older adults, providing privacy and freedom of expression for shy individuals. However, it lacks genuine human interaction and emotional support. Technical barriers for some older adults may limit its accessibility. Consequently, ChatGPT’s effectiveness for older adults’ care requires further research. ChatGPT integrates current psychological intervention strategies, aiding nurses in scientific mental health assessments. Through personal accounts, it enables early identification and intervention for negative emotions via continuous interactions. By integrating multimodal data, ChatGPT provides nurses with comprehensive insights, enhancing the effectiveness of psychological interventions [48]. ChatGPT self-identifies as a potential source of companionship and comfort for isolated older adults through conversations and interactions. Research confirms that communication technologies can help alleviate loneliness and social isolation in older populations [49]. Advanced language models like ChatGPT show the potential to enhance social engagement and alleviate loneliness among older adults while reducing labor costs. Consequently, this study will employ ChatGPT companion chats as an intervention to improve mood in older adults.Negative emotions such as loneliness and depression are common challenges faced by older adults, especially empty nesters, and can significantly impact their quality of life and social functioning. There are various programs, such as medication and psychotherapy, to deal with the problem of bad moods in older adults. The focus of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two modalities, ChatGPT Companion Chats and Mindfulness Exercises, in improving the negative moods of older adults, such as loneliness and depression. It is hoped that ChatGPT companion chats, as a novel technique, can alleviate negative moods in older adults. For older adults with medical conditions, ChatGPT companion chats may complement medication to enhance treatment effectiveness. Our research is motivated by a desire to contrast traditional, relatively specialized approaches with modern, technology-driven alternatives. Explore more possibilities for addressing mental health challenges in older adults. The study hypothesizes that both ChatGPT companion chats and mindfulness exercises could alleviate loneliness and depression in older adults, with no clear expectation of which intervention would yield superior results. Manual intervention usually requires trained professionals and is limited by time and place. This study hopes to explore the possibility of artificial intelligence replacing human intervention. Therefore, the focus of this study is to explore whether AI is effective in emotional intervention rather than to prove that ChatGPT is superior to mindfulness. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study DesignThe study used a controlled design to compare the effectiveness of ChatGPT Companion Chats and Mindfulness Exercises in improving loneliness and depression in older adults. Based on previous studies [50], an 8-week experiment was conducted in which participants were assigned to either the ChatGPT Group or the Mindfulness Group. Participants engaged in ChatGPT Companion Chats or Mindfulness Exercises for 15–30 min once a week. The researchers recorded participants’ mood, life satisfaction, and other relevant metrics at baseline (week 0) and at the end of the study (week 8).2.2. Ethical ConsiderationsEthical approval for the experiment was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University. The study’s details were approved by the participating organizations’ management. Informed consent was acquired from participants or primary caregivers. Participants could withdraw at any time. All information was anonymized, participation was voluntary, and confidentiality was assured for both participants and collaborators.2.3. ParticipantsNursing homes provide a uniform environment for older adults, reducing sample heterogeneity and controlling for potential confounders in experimental settings. Researchers contacted two local nursing home directors to recruit participants. Inclusion criteria were age over 60, Mandarin communication ability, and normal cognitive function (MMSE score > 26) with basic mobility and communication skills.2.4. Allocation to InterventionsParticipants from two Hangzhou nursing homes were divided into ChatGPT and Mindfulness groups. Each group underwent weekly 30-min sessions for 8 weeks. Loneliness, depression, and life satisfaction were measured pre- and post-experiment. Post-experiment focus group discussions were conducted. Only participants completing all sessions were included in the data analysis.2.4.1. ChatGPT GroupParticipants sat at a computer with a researcher providing assistance (Figure 1). The ChatGPT chatting method was explained, and both used headsets. Participants communicated verbally, with input converted to text and manually corrected if necessary. ChatGPT replies were presented as voice output to simulate live chat and reduce the reading burden. Researchers assisted with technology but did not interfere with chat content. The first session familiarized participants with the chat style, followed by seven 15–30 min one-on-one sessions.Figure 1.Open in a new tabChatGPT group.2.4.2. Mindfulness GroupA professional counseling expert-led participants in routine mindfulness practice, with researchers observing and assisting (Figure 2). Sessions followed the ‘Eight-Week Mindfulness Journey’ published by China Light Industry Publishing House, with varying content each week. Eight sessions were conducted in a one-to-many format. Specifically, this format refers to the structure where one facilitator (e.g., the mindfulness instructor) interacts with multiple participants simultaneously during the intervention sessions. The mindfulness sessions were conducted in a group setting, where the instructor guided the entire group of participants together.Figure 2.Open in a new tabMindfulness group.2.4.3. Focus GroupsFocus group interviews were conducted to gather supplementary insights. Two sessions were held following the conclusion of respective sub-experiments, each lasting approximately 30 min. The ChatGPT group comprised 2 researchers and 4 participants, focusing on the ChatGPT chaperone chat. The mindfulness group consisted of 2 researchers and 8 participants, centered on mindfulness practice. Researchers facilitated discussions as moderators and observers, respectively responsible for guiding topics and recording dialogue. The format included establishing rules, outlining objectives, in-depth discussions, and concluding remarks. Topics encompassed user experiences post-intervention, including prior usage, satisfaction, intervention impact, and interaction feedback. Researchers concluded sessions by expressing gratitude and encouragement to participants for their full participation, recognizing their adaptation to new technology, and ensuring a positive engagement experience.2.5. MeasurementsThis study utilized five scales, namely the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15), the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and the System Usability Scale (SUS).2.5.1. The Emotional State of Older AdultsAssessment of older adults’ emotional states utilized three mood scales. The Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15), developed by Sheikh and Yesavage, gauged depression symptoms with 15 yes-or-no questions. Scores, ranging from 0 to 15, indicated severity: 0–4 (none), 5–9 (mild), 10–14 (moderate), and 15 (severe) depression. The UCLA Loneliness Scale by Russell et al., comprising 20 items, measured loneliness on a 4-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. The Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) assessed older adults’ mood states via 32 items on a 4-point scale, delineating results across eight mood dimensions.2.5.2. Life SatisfactionThe Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), developed by Pavot and Diener, was used to assess psychological satisfaction with life among older adults, which was a measure of subjective well-being. The scale comprises 5 items rated on a 7-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.2.5.3. System UsabilityThe System Usability Scale (SUS), developed by Brooke, was used to measure the perceived usability of a product or system. It consisted of 10 items and was divided into three subscales: ‘Effectiveness & Learnability’, ‘Use Efficiency & Usability’, and ‘Satisfaction’. The scale employed a 5-point rating system. The SUS usability score was calculated based on a formula, with higher scores indicating better system usability.2.6. Data AnalysisThe measurement data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 27. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were performed with SPSS. Since the normal distribution was not satisfied, the Mann–Whitney test was used for comparison between the two groups, and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was used for comparison between the two groups. Process data and focus group content were analyzed using thematic analysis with MAXQDA 2020 [51]. Audio data were transcribed, and initial coding of raw text data was performed. A coding library was developed, followed by grouping data in a second round of coding. Researchers identified categories and themes, refining final themes based on Renn’s adaptation [52]. 3. ResultsThe chat companion experiment enrolled 15 participants, averaging 80.4 years old. Four females completed the process, averaging 88 years old, and were included in the final analysis. The mindfulness experiment involved nine participants, averaging 79.6 years old. Eight participants (seven females and one male) completed the process, averaging 78.6 years old, and were included in the final analysis.3.1. Participant CharacteristicsTable 1shows the demographic variables and baseline results of all participants who completed the study. The majority of participants were female, with 11 (91.7%) female and 1 (8.3%) male. One participant (8.3%) had no formal education, six participants (50%) had primary school education, two participants (16.7%) had middle school education, two participants (16.7%) had high school education, and one participant (8.3%) had a university degree. Aside from the difference in educational background (p= 0.036 < 0.05), where the Chat group had a higher education level than the Mindfulness group, there were no significant differences between the two groups in other conditions. Ten participants reported mild depressive symptoms, and one participant reported moderate depressive symptoms.Table 1.Participant characteristics (n = 12).VariableChat (n = 4)Mindfulness (n = 8)pn (%)MedianQ1n (%)MedianQ1GenderMale4 (100.0)7 (87.5)0.480Female0 (0)1 (12.5)Educational backgroundnot attending school0 (0)5.02.81 (12.5)2.02.00.036 *secondary schools1 (25.0)5 (62.5)Junior high school0 (0)2 (25)three-year college0 (0)0 (0)High school2 (50.0)0 (0)University1 (25.0)0 (0)postgraduate education0 (0)0 (0)GDS-15 score6.03.87.06.00.146UCLA score12.07.814.04.80.932BRUMS scoreanger2.51.32.50.31.000tension3.01.31.50.30.227depression1.50.31.00.00.663vigor4.50.39.07.30.119fatigue7.52.83.01.30.147confusion4.02.31.00.30.086happy7.004.811.010.00.057calmness11.57.012.09.30.665SELE score22.519.327.526.00.230Open in a new tab*p< 0.05.Table 2shows the changes in outcomes for the different groups.

There was also a certain degree of increase in vitality, happiness, and life satisfaction, but loneliness also increased. The participants in the mindfulness group showed a decrease in depression scores. Among them, one participant transitioned from moderate to mild depressive symptoms, and one participant transitioned from mild to moderate. There were no significant between-group differences in any of the data, suggesting to some extent that there is no difference in effectiveness between ChatGPT chaperone chat and mindfulness practice.3.2. Thematic AnalysisTwo focus group sessions were conducted, with four participants engaging in discussions on ChatGPT chaperone chat and eight participating in discussions on mindfulness practice. Qualitative analysis of the chat content and focus group discussions revealed three main themes and their subcategories (Table 3), with representative quotes explaining each category.Table 3.Themes and categories reported by participants after the focus group.ThemesCategoriespersonal experienceExperience with AI or mindfulnessThere is a dependence on smartphonesNew to AI/mindfulnessAttitudes and perspectivesThere are benefits to chatting with ChatGPT or mindfulness practiceChange in moodDo not think this is a good form of AINeeds and expectationsPrefer bionic-looking forms, real human contactImpact of hearing deteriorationI hope to be able to use it in my daily lifeOpen in a new tab3.2.1. Personal ExperienceAll participants reported no exposure to ChatGPT. However, some participants mentioned similar experiences with AI contact. For instance, subject d (84 years old) remarked, ‘Sometimes when I go to the hospital with a cold, there will be a robot, and you can ask it which ward is on what floor. Which floor should I go to if I want to see a doctor’. The conversational pattern of the hospital guide robot bears some resemblance to the experimental intelligent companion chat, which brought a sense of familiarity to older adults. The study suggests that older adults find the use of AI technology acceptable. They perceived that service robots could assist them in performing their daily tasks more effectively [53]. Some participants had prior exposure to mindfulness or similar exercises, such as meditation. Subject k (78 years old) commented, ‘I’ve learned some relaxation and meditation techniques at the community center before, but I haven’t practiced them systematically’.Several participants indicated that they have experience with smartphones, and some exhibit a strong dependency and fondness for them. Subject c (92 years old) mentioned in the chat, ‘My daughter took my smartphone away, which makes me quite angry right now. I am really sad inside without it. Since I’ve had a smartphone for 14 years, I will not use a senior phone. When I’m without my smartphone, I get sad’. Studies reveal a favorable relationship between the amount of time spent on smartphones and smartphone addiction [54]. Subject c (92 years old) was the participant who had been using a smartphone for a long time and showed a strong need for it. Another participant mentioned, ‘I use my phone to read the news and watch wellness programs, especially medical-related ones. It’s important to have some understanding, and I enjoy it’. This suggests that older folks, who can also use smart technology and benefit from its convenience, have found greater ease in their lives as a result of its advancements. However, some older adults said that they feel unfamiliar with artificial intelligence because they do not have a smartphone but only an old-age phone. In a similar vein, some older adults have never heard of mindfulness. Subject h (85 years old) stated, ‘I have never come into contact with mindfulness; this is kind of my first experience and I find it quite refreshing’.3.2.2. Attitudes and PerspectivesSome older adults who experience a chaperoned conversation say they benefit from it and will prepare for it or look forward to it before they have it. Subject d (84 years old) would set a theme or question for herself before each conversation, and the conversation would revolve around the theme. She said during the discussion: ‘Every conversation, I thought of a question and it would give me a more comprehensive answer than what I had thought of on my own. It knows a lot about what’s going on in life. Once I asked it about its views on genetically modified foods and its answer was not one-sided. I think that’s still instructive’. Many older adults expressed positive attitudes towards mindfulness. A subject said, ‘I feel that mindfulness practice has not only brought me peace and relaxation mentally but has also had a positive impact in other aspects of my life. For example, I find myself paying more attention to healthy eating and getting enough sleep, as well as paying more attention to the good things around me’. And the subject said, ‘I think mindfulness practice has made me appreciate each day more’. Participants in both groups saw their life satisfaction scores rise after the intervention, and the upward trend was close to significant.There were also older adults who gradually began to change their attitudes as the chatting progressed. Subject a (88 years old) conversations started with ‘no’, ‘I have nothing to say’, and ‘there is nothing I want to ask’. After that, she started to chat and would take the initiative to greet, ‘Old friend, we meet again, how are you’. The change in response also reflects the change in mood and emotion of older adults. Older adults grew more laid back and gregarious as the number of interactions rose. Some older adults also said: ‘I feel better after chatting’. Additionally, compared to non-users, internet users reported feeling more support from friends and family [55]. On the other hand, participants in the mindfulness group mentioned certain challenges they encountered. ‘During the experiment, sometimes I would feel that I lacked motivation and patience and it was hard to keep going’. ‘Sometimes my thoughts would wander to other places and it was hard to concentrate’.Some of the older adults involved in the chat group expressed that the experimental format was less engaging and that the requirement for standard Mandarin in dialog recognition posed challenges. For example, subject d (84 years old) said: ‘Young people speak good Mandarin, but my generation didn’t have pinyin or anything like that when we were studying, so we usually spoke dialects. I’m from Ningbo and speak the Ningbo dialect, so it doesn’t understand this dialect’. Another subject said, ‘Sometimes the words I say are not understood by it, and you have to adjust them on the side, or the words that appear differ from what I say’. The care home’s director remarked, ‘This companion talk feels a touch too robotic. It’s quick and rigid. Older adults are bored and unable to use computers when they are using them’. Research indicates that older adults experience declines in language comprehension with age, leading to poorer performance compared to younger counterparts in understanding complex conversations [56]. Hence, there is a need for further refinement of the current form of accompanied conversation to enhance older adults’ comprehension and utilization of this technology.3.2.3. Needs and ExpectationsNumerous individuals have shared their opinions and views on AI technology. Older adults typically communicate online through voice or handwritten text, so visual and auditory aspects are highly valued by them during accompanied conversations. Some older adults may prefer forms that imitate real beings, such as charming and cartoonish designs, like little animals. Robots are not very popular. A subject said: ‘If the robot is a very cute shape, like a Barbie doll or a big monkey, it will also offer to say hello. That kind of is very likable’. Some participants indicated that sight and hearing include not only appearance but also mannerisms and tone of voice, and some expressed a preference for interacting with real people. The director of the nursing home said: ‘Older adults prefer their children to come and see them offline when they live here, not just through a telephone greeting. They prefer real contact. Older adults also rarely use video calls’. Additionally, prior research has demonstrated that older persons still prioritize face-to-face communication above other forms of communication, even despite the rapid advancement of online communication tools [57].Researchers observed the impact of hearing loss on older adults during both the process and interviews. Due to age-related decline, their ability to use voice-based systems was affected [58], necessitating devices with higher volume. During the experiment, some older adults opted to read text responses because they could not hear the device’s voice replies clearly. Some subjects said, ‘It’s not that they don’t want to use a smartphone, but senior phones are simpler and loud’. Thus, auditory design is a point of concern for products used by older adults.Participants in the mindfulness group showed a highly positive attitude towards this format, expressing a desire for deeper understanding and the ability to apply it in their daily lives. Subject g (78 years old) said, ‘I learned some practical skills and strategies through this experiment. I hope I can better apply mindfulness practice in my future life’. Subject l (80 years old) said: ‘I think mindfulness has helped me with my emotional management. I hope I can still learn more to apply it to my life and improve my quality of life’. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that mindfulness training can improve the mental and physical health of older adults by teaching them to accept and cope with chronic illnesses more effectively [59]. 4. DiscussionOverall, we discovered that individuals’ feelings of depression and loneliness did not significantly change as a result of either ChatGPT companionship or mindfulness practice. Nonetheless, following the intervention, the data showed a decrease in negative emotions in both groups, with no discernible variations between the groups. This inadvertently implies that ChatGPT can function similarly to mindfulness in mitigating negative emotions in older adults and that both companionship and mindfulness have similar benefits in decreasing negative emotions in older adults.In particular, after the trial, Subject h (85 years old) depression score dropped from 11 (moderate depressed symptoms) to 5 (mild depressive symptoms). He said he ‘felt much better mentally, and the worries were not as heavy’ following the practice. This is similar to Subject g (80 years old), ‘performing these exercises helped my mind feel extremely relaxed; I used to overthink a lot’. Subject d (84 years old) saw a decrease in her depression level in the ChatGPT group as well. ‘Chatting with ChatGPT was quite enjoyable; it felt like catching up with an old friend’, the woman said.After the trial, the loneliness score of the 85-year-old individual increased from 4 to 13. ‘I used to think about the past when I meditated, and now I feel more and more alone’, she said in her explanation. In contrast, there were notable individual variances even while the ChatGPT group’s aggregate level of loneliness rose. For instance, the loneliness score of subject b (88 years old) dropped from 24 to 7. ‘ChatGPT feels like my little companion, someone I can talk to’, she said with a smile.There could be several factors contributing to these outcomes. First of all, medical issues, social support, and familial ties are just a few of the variables that can impact depression and lonely experiences in older persons [60]. It may not be possible to achieve notable benefits with a single, brief session. Second, research from the past suggests that emotional state modifications take time [61], so the 8-week intervention period may not be long enough to see the full benefits. Individual psychological adjustment capacities may also have an effect on the results. For instance, Auntie Cheng, who finished the study, saw a decline in her physical well-being and a reduction in family visits, both of which added to her depressive feelings.During the experiment, a few notable situations were noted. There was no visual interface during the technology-assisted chat sessions, so communication was restricted to text and speech. Both visual attractiveness and engagement suffered as a result. A higher dropout rate was also caused by the older adults’ decreased capacity to adopt new technology. However, several participants thought that mindfulness exercises were abstract. ‘I don’t entirely comprehend the importance of those behaviors’, said subject j (74 years old). It is interesting that in the chat group, the four who completed the process are nearly 8 years older than the average for the 15 that started. Older participants may have had more time or motivation to complete the intervention, which could be a factor worth exploring in future studies. One of the limitations of the study is the relatively small and unbalanced sample sizes, with 15 participants in the ChatGPT group and 9 in the mindfulness group. This may limit the generalizability of the results. We observed several compliance-related challenges during the study. Some participants struggled to maintain consistent engagement with the 8-week intervention. For example, some participants stopped participating midway because they went to the hospital for treatment, and some participants refused to continue because they were not willing to express themselves. Future research could benefit from larger, more balanced samples to improve statistical power and the reliability of the findings.In conclusion, despite the little overall improvement, the majority of participants expressed a greater sense of life satisfaction and gave the experimental forms positive feedback. This result is consistent with other research that indicates mindfulness techniques [62] and virtual communication [63] can provide older persons with social support and coping mechanisms, which can improve their quality of life [64]. Thus, we think that in the future, offering older adults a variety of easy social and psychological support channels through the use of technology and psychological interventions would be crucial. The study also shows that older persons have distinct preferences for the types and contents of interventions, highlighting the need for more individualized and humanized service solutions that cater to the needs of various populations. 5. ConclusionsThe purpose of this study was to look at how mindfulness training and ChatGPT companionship affected depressive and lonely feelings in older persons. We discovered that, in the short term, both ChatGPT companionship and mindfulness meditation had rather limited impacts on significantly reducing depression symptoms and feelings of loneliness in older persons based on trials conducted with elderly patients in nursing homes.It is noteworthy, nevertheless, that both groups of older persons exhibited some degree of reduction in negative emotion scores, even if there was no fundamental shift in emotions. This implies that, in contrast to conventional mindfulness therapies, cutting-edge artificial intelligence-based interactive modes like ChatGPT might also be useful for reducing negative emotions and enhancing the mental health of older adults.Actually, giving older adults a technique to relax their bodies and minds and concentrate on the here and now helps them change their attention and control their emotions, which is largely why mindfulness interventions are so successful. Even though ChatGPT takes a different tack, it nonetheless gives older adults a chance to engage with the outside world by mimicking human speech. This gives them a brief break from an inactive, alone existence, which in turn promotes some level of relaxation and comfort.Thus, the results of this study offer important new information about how the new technology ChatGPT can improve older adults’ feelings. Investigating how to more effectively use intelligent tools to meet the social and psychological needs of older adults and achieve a positive interaction between humans and machines will be an important topic worth looking into as artificial intelligence technology continues to develop and improve. To improve affinity and attraction, AI partners may, in the future, be equipped with more personalized and human designs. In addition, older adults can have complete companionship experiences in immersive virtual environments made possible by VR/AR technologies."

        "Title": "Alcohol Abuse and Physical Violence towards a Partner: How Can We Attenuate the Relationship? A Study on Emotional Dysregulation in Adolescents",
        "Abstract": "AbstractBackground: The previous literature has revealed the relationship between alcohol abuse and violent behaviours; however, the results are not always conclusive, highlighting the need to explore other variables that allow us to establish risk profiles. Aim: The goal is to examine whether the relation between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards a partner can be influenced (moderate) by difficulties in emotional regulation. Setting: A public high school in Manabí (Ecuador). Participants: A total of 1519 high school students with ages between 14 and 18 years (mean = 15.77, SD = 1.22), with 54% (n= 820) being male. Main Outcome Measures: The measures we observed were alcohol abuse (i.e., frequency of alcohol abuse in the past 30 days), physical violence exercised towards a partner (Violence Received, Exercised and Perceived in Dating Relationships of Young People and Adolescents) and emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale; DERS). Results: It is observed that there exists significantly higher alcohol abuse in males, regardless of their age, as well as more physical violence by adolescent males towards their partners. Direct effects of alcohol abuse on physical intimate partner violence are observed in males from the age of 16 and in females from the age of 14. Moreover, the direct effects of different emotional dysregulation strategies on physical violence depend on gender. Conclusion: The moderating effects of emotional dysregulation strategies between alcohol abuse and physical intimate partner violence are observed only in the case of adolescent females (16–17 years). In particular, emotional dysregulation variables such as non-awareness, impulse, nonacceptance, or lack of strategies interfere as moderators in the relationship between excessive alcohol abuse and physical violence towards a partner. In the case of non-awareness, contrary to the other three, when scores are low or moderate, a statistically significant relationship between alcohol abuse and violence is observed.Keywords:adolescence, alcohol abuse, violence against partner, emotional dysregulation, awareness, gender",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionTeen dating violence (TDV), recognised as an important and widespread public health problem, refers to any conduct within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological, or sexual harm to either partner [1]. Despite the large variability found, the previous literature indicate that around 20% of adolescents report having experienced physical and psychological TDV and 9% report having experienced sexual TDV [2,3].Previous studies have focused on establishing risk profiles for TDV. Initial studies focused on the influence of gender and age, but did not find conclusive results. The results do, however, show a differential profile depending on these variables. Thus, while boys in earlier adolescence report more fear and injury victimisation, girls in later adolescence report more injury perpetration and suffer greater psychological consequences [2,4,5].What appears to be a common denominator in the previous literature is that TDV entails devastating emotional and physical effects, regardless of age and gender [4]. Other socio-demographic variables have also been analysed as risk factors, such as socio-demographic and territorial level, as living in disadvantaged countries or neighbourhoods where there is a higher rate of violence may increase the likelihood of experiencing TDV [3,6].According to the National Survey on Family Relations and Gender Violence against Women (ENVIGMU) [7], 64.9% of women in Ecuador report having experienced violence in their lifetime. Of these, 40.8% have occurred in the intimate partner sphere, with psychological violence being the most prevalent and generally becoming the step prior to physical violence [8]. It should be noted that although these data were collected on a sample of women over 15 years of age, no explicit results were obtained on the prevalence of intimate partner violence against women during adolescence.Different theories have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of intimate partner violence in adolescence. Of these, the most widely accepted is based on the social learning theory [9], which is still very consistent with the intergenerational model of domestic violence [10]. This theory states that an aggressive and repressive interpersonal style is learned through experiences of violence in the family of origin. Parental childhood experiences of abuse are not associated with abusive behaviour towards children but are associated with other forms of violence towards partners or non-family members [11]. Such experiences of family violence in childhood may result in increased negative affectivity and emotional dysregulation [12].There are different models of emotional regulation that are key to understanding the use of problem behaviours as a strategy to cope with unpleasant emotions. Gross’s [13] process model of emotional regulation is organised in phases, namely situation, attention, interpretation, and response, differentiating between antecedent-based and response-focused regulation. This model suggests that people can avoid situations or focus on certain aspects to regulate their emotions, although it has limitations, such as the omission of emotional acceptance, and it may promote avoidant behaviours. On the other hand, Hervás’ [14] model based on emotional processing proposes an active understanding of emotions through six phases, namely opening, attention, acceptance, labelling, analysis, and emotional modulation. This model highlights the importance of understanding and managing emotions appropriately, pointing out that substance use can be an external self-regulatory strategy to alleviate negative emotional states, as shown in studies by Fernández et al. [15] and Echeburúa [16] (1999). A recent review examines precisely the relationship between a lack of emotional regulation and substance abuse [17]. Similarly, the use of violence is related to difficulties in emotional regulation and poor coping strategies, especially in the adolescent population [18].In this regard, results obtained in a study of gender-based violence in the province of Bolivar (Ecuador) show how excessive alcohol can be established as one of the main predictors of intimate partner aggression (IPA) [19]. Despite the established association, little research has attempted to identify the mechanisms that mediate alcohol consumption and the perpetration of IPA [20]. The identification of these variables is particularly relevant, as despite the strong association between heavy drinking and IPA, little research corroborates that heavy drinking exerts a necessary or sufficient condition for partner aggression [21], as the former does not lead to the latter in all people or circumstances, but rather alcohol abuse contributes to or facilitates the occurrence of aggression [22]. In this context, it is particularly relevant to know under which circumstances or under which personality profiles these associations are established, which would provide us with a basis for violence prevention even when excessive alcohol consumption occurs. The few existing studies on the subject indicate that a pattern of heavy drinking is more consistently associated with IPA when it is moderated by factors related to self-regulation. In this sense, the emotional self-regulation of both partners may interact with alcohol consumption and influence the risk of aggression towards the partner [22,23].Specifically, previous studies have indicated that in men with limited access to emotional regulation strategies and greater impulse control difficulties, the association between heavy alcohol consumption and TDV was stronger [24]. Emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and hostility are constructs that are significantly and moderately correlated with each other and are associated with the perpetration of intimate partner violence at the psychological, physical, and sexual levels. Impulsivity has been shown to influence emotional dysregulation and hostility in the case of psychological and sexual intimate partner violence, whereas in the perpetration of physical violence, it was hostility that influenced emotional dysregulation and impulsivity [23].Going deeper into emotional dysregulation, studies that have used the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS) for its measurement have observed that in the case of males, physical violence is not related to any subscale of emotional dysregulation; however, in the case of females, significant positive associations of physical violence with difficulties in impulse control, a lack of emotional awareness, limited access to emotional regulation strategies, and a lack of emotional clarity were found. In the case of psychological aggression, a positive and significant relationship with difficulties in impulse control and a lack of emotional clarity has been found in males. Among females, significant and positive relationships of psychological aggression were observed with difficulties in impulse control, difficulties in goal-directed behaviour, a lack of emotional clarity, and limited access to emotional regulation strategies [4].As can be seen, the previous literature has established a relationship between excessive alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence [20,25,26], while the latter has been associated with certain emotional dysregulation strategies with differential profiles in men and women [22]. However, to our knowledge, little is known about the influence of emotional dysregulation strategies on the relationship between heavy drinking and physical IPA, and to what extent this influence may be gender- or age-dependent. Therefore, the main objective of the present research is to analyse the possible moderating role of emotional dysregulation strategies between excessive alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence in an adolescent population in Ecuador (seeFigure 1). This possible influence will be analysed while taking into account gender and different age groups. The identification of these factors in an adolescent population can help to improve etiological models and forms of prevention and intervention that will be carried out later with much more defined risk groups.Figure 1.Open in a new tabProposed model. 2. Material and Methods2.1. DesignA cross-sectional correlational study was used.2.2. ParticipantsThe sample consisted of 1519 schooled adolescents, of whom 53.9% were male (n= 826), aged between 14 and 18 years (M = 15.76, SD = 1.25) and belonging to twelve public education units of the different urban (63.86%;n= 979) and rural (36.13%;n= 554) socio-demographic sectors of the Portoviejo Canton of the Province of Manabí in the Republic of Ecuador.A probabilistic method was used with stratified random sampling with proportional allocation, and the distribution was based on the weight or size within the population. Stratification was based on the number of educational units, the number of adolescents per class, urban and rural parishes, and the distribution of classes by sex. The reference population consisted of adolescents attending public schools of the urban and rural parishes of the Portoviejo Canton in the Province of Manabí (Republic of Ecuador) who belong to different socio-demographic sectors with common characteristics and constitute the object of the study. Specifically, adolescents in the tenth grade and the first, second, and third year of high school participated in the study. In order to obtain the sample, Ecuador’s official bodies were considered (National Council for the Control of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances, 2005), which is now known as the Technical Secretariat on Drugs (SETED). The sample design and sample size were defined and calculated following the same criteria as those used in the report of the second National Survey of Secondary School Students on Drug Use (2005) of the Republic of Ecuador conducted by the National Council for the Control of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances. These parameters used for the calculation, as referred to by the council in the report, are those applied to all studies and carried out across the continent. The target population was the fiscal educational units of adolescents in the tenth grade and the first, second, and third year of baccalaureate studies. The selection of the educational units was obtained from the database of the Ministry of Education Zonal Coordination 4 district 13D01; the educational units belong to the canton, established parish, and zone of institution (urban and rural), and support was related to the fiscal educational units and representative of different socio-demographic zones of the Canton of Portoviejo. A confidence level of 0.95 with a margin of error of 0.015 was used to calculate the sample size. Due to the sampling characteristics, a correction factor was considered due to the design effect to increase the sample size and decrease the variability of the observations; this factor was estimated at 2. Finally, the sample size was increased to compensate for a 10% possible non-response.2.3. ProcedureThis study was carried out with a rigorous commitment to the ethical standards governing psychological research. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [27] and approved by the Ministry of Education of Portoviejo (Ecuador), and the academic committee of the doctoral programme in Social Work (Complutense University of Madrid, Spain) approved it, considering its scientific quality adequate and not identifying any ethical issues for its development.Informed consent forms were submitted and signed by the parents and/or guardians of the adolescents who completed the questionnaires. They were also informed of the rules for completion, the duration and questions to be measured, the voluntary nature of the study, the confidentiality and anonymity of the data obtained, and the telephone number and e-mail addresses of the reference researchers for contacting them. Since the data collection was carried out in paper format, during the administration of the questionnaires, the researchers remained in the classroom with the students until all the completed questionnaires were returned to them. The students who collaborated in the research received a pencil and a certificate of participation as a token of appreciation.2.4. Variables and Instruments2.4.1. Alcohol AbuseAn item assessing the frequency of alcohol abuse in the past 30 days (“In the last 30 days how many days have you been drunk by drinking alcoholic beverages?”) was used with an 8-point Likert-type response format, with the scores as follows: 0 (no day), 1 (1 day), 2 (2 days), 3 (3 days), 4 (4–5 days), 5 (6–9 days), 6 (10–19 days), 7 (20–30 days). This item is extracted from the Survey on Drug Use in Secondary Education in Spain [28] (ESTUDES). The ESTUDES survey is part of a long-running series of biennial surveys conducted in Spain since 1994. Its main goal is to understand the patterns and trends in drug use among students aged 14–18 enrolled in secondary education. The survey comprises 89 questions that collect data on various aspects, including basic personal and environmental characteristics (P.1–P.17), leisure activities (P.18–P.20), lifetime, past–year, or past–month tobacco use (P.21–P.31), alcohol consumption (P.32–P.43), the use of tranquillisers, sedatives, and sleeping pills (P.44), over-the-counter tranquillisers and sedatives (P.45), and other drug types (P.46–P.61). It also covers issues experienced in the past year, family rules (P.62–P.75), drug availability (P.76–P.77), access to information (P.78–P.81), perceptions of the problem (P.82–P.83), renewed cannabis use (P.84), questions from international surveys (P.85–P.88), and suggestions for improving the questionnaire (P.89). A pilot test was conducted beforehand to assess the length and clarity of the questions.2.4.2. Intimate Partner Physical ViolenceThe corresponding dimension of the Scale of Violence Received, Exercised and Perceived in Dating Relationships of Young People and Adolescents—VREP [29] used. VREP allows for the evaluation of five types of violence (physical, sexual, psychological–social, psychological humiliation—coercion, and psychological control—jealousy) and three aspects of violence (exerted, received, and perceived) through 28 items. The physical violence subscale assessed in this study consists of 5 items with a Likert-type response format with 6 response alternatives (0: “Never”, 1: “Once”, 2: “2 to 5 times”, 3: “6 to 10 times”, 4: “11 to 15 times” and 5: “More than 15 times”). Some of the items on the scale are as follows: “I pinched him with the intention of hurting him” and “I have deliberately bitten or pulled his hair”. It is worth mentioning that a higher score on the items indicates a stronger presence of violence (in any of its forms), whether experienced, perpetrated, or perceived. In order to complete the scale, participants were required to have or have had at least one relationship of more than a one-month duration. Participants are asked to indicate whether the situations described have occurred or are occurring in their relationships and how often they occur. In the original study, the scale had a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.99 [29]. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the physical violence subscale was 0.94.2.4.3. Difficulties in Emotional RegulationThe Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale—DERS [30] in its Spanish version [31] by Gómez-Simón et al. (2014) was used. The scale contains 36 items with a Likert-type response scale of five options from 0 (“Almost never”) to 5 (“Almost always”). This instrument allows the assessment of six emotional regulation deficits as follows: a lack of emotional awareness (difficulties in admitting emotional states and tending to these emotions, i.e., “When I’m upset, I become embarrassed for feeling that way”), difficulties in impulse control (difficulties in controlling certain behaviours triggered by experiencing negative emotions, i.e., “When I’m upset, I become out of control”), a lack of emotional acceptance (showing a negative emotional response to a negative primary emotional stimulus, i.e., “When I’m upset, I become embarrassed for feeling that way”), interference in goal-directed behaviour (impairment or difficulty in concentration after experiencing negative emotions, i.e., “When I’m upset, I have difficulty getting work done”), a lack of emotional clarity (difficulty or lack of clarity in understanding or knowing one’s own emotions, i.e., “I have no idea how I am feeling”), and limited access to emotional regulation strategies (perceived inability to modify a negative emotional state, i.e., “When I’m upset, it takes me a long time to feel better”). A higher score implies a greater deficit in emotional regulation. In the instrument’s validation, the internal consistency of the subscales ranged from moderate to satisfactory (0.71–0.88) [31]. In the present study, the following Cronbach’s alphas were found for each of the strategies: nonacceptance of emotional responses (0.82), difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviours (0.73), impulse control difficulties (0.80), a lack of emotional awareness (0.84), limited access to emotion regulation strategies (0.79), and a lack of emotional clarity (0.81).2.5. Statistical AnalysisIBM SPSS Statistics version 27.0 [32] was used for data analysis. Univariate normality, multivariate normality, and linearity were assessed with graphical methods such as histograms and Q–Q plots. Frequency analyses were carried out in relation to alcohol abuse. Mean difference analyses were carried out for independent groups (Student’st-test) on the variables under study (excessive alcohol abuse, physical violence against a partner, and emotional dysregulation strategies). Specifically, two types of analyses were carried out, one with respect to gender (males vs. females) and one with respect to age group (14–15 years vs. 16–18 years). A series of multivariate regressions were then computed with the PROCESS macro (model 1) [33]. In each regression, a combination of the independent variable (i.e., excessive alcohol abuse), the moderator (i.e., emotional dysregulation strategy), and their interaction was entered to predict the outcome (i.e., physical violence against a partner). These analyses were further conducted in four distinct subgroups, which were males aged 14–15 years, males aged 16–18 years, females aged 14–15 years, and females aged 16–18 years. In total, 24 multivariate regressions were performed (6 for each subgroup). Post hoc analyses were calculated when significant moderation was found to obtain the conditional effects of the independent variables on outcomes at different levels of the moderator. An alpha level of 0.05 was set for all analyses. 3. Results3.1. Differences in Excessive Alcohol Abuse, Physical Violence against Partners, and Emotional Dysregulation Strategies According to Gender and AgeTable 1shows the frequencies and percentages for each of the alcohol consumption response options, including the median value.Table 2presents the mean values for alcohol abuse, physical violence towards partners, and the different emotional regulation strategies, including a comparison of means according to gender and age. As can be seen inTable 1andTable 2, males show significantly higher frequencies than females in excessive alcohol abuse (p< 0.001), although the effect sizes point to a weak association. Physical violence towards partners also shows significantly higher values for males (p= 0.04). Regarding differences by age group, statistically significant differences were observed in physical violence against partners, with higher scores in the 16–18 years of age group than in the 14–15 years of age group (p= 0.01).Table 1.Excessive alcohol abuse.

Likewise, in that same age group (16–18 years), a significant main effect of all emotional dysregulation strategies was found on physical violence against partners, in all cases positive, except for “lack of emotional awareness”.Table 3.Multivariate hierarchical regression analyses predicting physical violence against partner from excessive alcohol abuse, emotional dysregulation strategies, and their interaction (in men).Men 14–15 YearsMen 16–18 YearsRFpBetatp95% CIRFpBetatp95% CI0.070.510.630.207.08<0.001Alcohol abuse−0.09−0.540.58−0.44, 0.250.363.78<0.0010.17, 0.55Awareness−0.06−1.180.23−0.17, 0.04−0.07−2.530.01−0.13, −0.02Interaction<0.010.170.85−0.06, 0.070.010.900.36−0.02, 0.050.030.110.950.2814.11<0.001Alcohol abuse−0.09−0.560.57−0.44, 0.240.333.45<0.0010.14, 0.52Impulse0.010.180.85−0.11, 0.130.165.24<0.0010.10, 0.22Interaction<0.010.040.96−0.07, 0.07<0.0010.050.96−0.04, 0.040.060.460.700.218.03<0.001Alcohol abuse−0.10−0.580.55−0.45, 0.240.363.66<0.0010.17, 0.56Nonacceptance0.010.310.75−0.07, 0.100.062.800.0050.02, 0.11Interaction0.020.970.32−0.02, 0.07−0.02−1.180.24−0.05, 0.010.070.660.570.229.11<0.001Alcohol abuse−0.10−0.580.56−0.45, 0.240.373.90<0.0010.19, 0.57Goals0.050.790.42−0.08, 0.200.143.200.0010.05, 0.22Interaction0.051.070.28−0.04, 0.14−0.04−1.190.23−0.09, 0.020.060.400.740.196.64<0.001Alcohol abuse−0.06−0.370.70−0.41, 0.280.343.45<0.0010.15, 0.54Clarity−0.06−0.690.48−0.25, 0.120.112.420.010.02, 0.19Interaction−0.04−0.730.46−0.17, 0.07<0.01−0.070.94−0.06, 0.060.040.190.890.2611.86<0.001Alcohol abuse−0.10−0.590.54−0.46, 0.240.313.16<0.010.12, 0.50Strategies0.030.520.59−0.08, 0.150.134.60<0.0010.08, 0.19Interaction<0.010.230.81−0.06, 0.08<0.010.090.92−0.04, 0.04Open in a new tabAwareness: lack of emotional awareness.

None of the emotional dysregulation strategies have direct effects on this age group (14–15 years). No interaction effect is observed.Table 4.Multivariate hierarchical regression analyses predicting physical violence against partners from excessive alcohol abuse, emotional dysregulation strategies, and their interaction (in women).Women 14–15 YearsWomen 16–18 YearsRFpBetatp95% CIRFpBetatp95% CI0.131.830.140.247.57<0.001Alcohol abuse0.322.300.020.04, 0.600.383.33<0.0010.15, 0.60Awareness<0.010.140.88−0.06, 0.07−0.04−1.480.13−0.10, 0.01Interaction0.020.950.34−0.02, 0.08−0.08−3.69<0.001−0.13, −0.030.142.140.090.3012.79<0.001Alcohol abuse0.271.930.05<0.01, 0.550.211.910.04<0.01, 0.43Impulse0.041.340.17−0.02, 0.100.155.21<0.0010.09, 0.21Interaction<0.01−0.090.92−0.05, 0.040.052.270.02<0.01, 0.100.121.810.140.3113.34<0.001Alcohol abuse0.312.190.020.03, 0.600.262.360.010.04, 0.48Nonacceptance0.010.540.58−0.03, 0.060.063.04<0.010.02, 0.11Interaction−0.01−0.770.44−0.04, 0.020.074.87<0.0010.04, 0.110.121.600.180.184.49<0.01Alcohol abuse0.302.180.020.03, 0.580.322.83<0.010.10, 0.55Goals−0.01−0.320.74−0.10, 0.070.082.140.03<0.01, 0.16Interaction−0.01−0.370.70−0.08, 0.050.051.630.10−0.01, 0.120.131.880.130.142.730.04Alcohol abuse0.322.310.020.04, 0.600.292.470.010.06, 0.52Clarity<0.01−0.020.97−0.09, 0.090.041.080.27−0.03, 0.13Interaction−0.03−1.020.30−0.11, 0.03<0.01−0.220.82−0.07, 0.060.131.890.130.247.56<0.001Alcohol abuse0.251.760.07−0.02, 0.530.242.150.030.02, 0.47Strategies0.020.930.34−0.03, 0.080.082.94<0.010.02, 0.14Interaction0.010.470.63−0.03, 0.050.062.65<0.010.01, 0.09Open in a new tabAwareness: lack of emotional awareness.

Strategies: limited access to emotion regulation strategies.In females aged 16–18 years, a positive main effect of excessive alcohol abuse was found on physical violence against partners in all models. Likewise, in that same age group (16–18 years), a significant main effect of emotional dysregulation strategies was found on physical violence against partners, except for “lack of emotional awareness” and “lack of emotional clarity”. In all cases where the relationship is significant, it is positive. In this age group (16–18 years), four moderation effects of emotional dysregulation strategies were revealed, one in the relationship between alcohol abuse and “lack of emotional awareness” in physical violence against partners (β = −0.08, t = −3.69,p< 0.001, 95% CI = −0.13, −0.03), another in the relationship between alcohol abuse and “Impulse control difficulties” in physical violence against partners (β = 0.05, t = 2.27,p= 0.02, 95% CI = <0.01, 0.10), another one in the relationship between alcohol abuse and “Nonacceptance of emotional responses” in physical violence against partners (β = 0.07, t = 4.87,p< 0.001, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.11), and a final one in the relationship between alcohol abuse and “limited access to emotion regulation strategies” in physical violence against partners (β = 0.06, t = 2.65,p< 0.01, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.09).As noted inTable 5, in the case of “limited access to emotion regulation strategies”, “impulse control difficulties”, and “nonacceptance of emotional responses”, the analyses of the conditional effects indicated that the strength of the (positive) relationship between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards a partner increased notably as emotional dysregulation strategies increased. In particular, the association between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards a partner was no longer significant at low levels of these emotional dysregulation strategies.Table 5.Conditional effects of alcohol abuse on physical violence (towards a partner) at values of emotional dysregulation strategies (women, 16–18 years).StrategiesBeta (Alcohol Abuse)tp95% CIAwarenessBeta (Alcohol Abuse)tp95% CI−5.58−0.07−0.410.67−0.41, 0.26−5.390.844.59<0.0010.48, 1.20−0.580.211.830.06−0.01, 0.44−0.390.413.56<0.0010.18, 0.645.570.563.59<0.0010.25, 0.875.60−0.09−0.600.54−0.40, 0.21ImpulseBeta (alcohol abuse)tp95% CINonacceptanceBeta (alcohol abuse)tp95% CI−4.50−0.04−0.270.78−0.37, 0.28−7.10−0.29−1.790.07−0.61, 0.02−0.500.181.620.10−0.03, 0.41−2.100.090.830.40−0.13, 0.335.490.533.14<0.010.19, 0.867.890.885.35<0.0010.55, 1.20Open in a new tabStrategies: limited access to emotion regulation strategies.

Nonacceptance: nonacceptance of emotional responses.On the contrary, in the case of “lack of emotional awareness”, the association between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards a partner was only significant at low and medium levels of this emotional dysregulation strategy. That is, the greater the use of emotional awareness as an emotional regulation strategy, the greater the relationship between alcohol abuse and intimate partner violence. 4. DiscussionThis paper aims to shed some light on the possible moderating role that emotional dysregulation strategies may have in the well-known association between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards partners in adolescence [20,25,26]. We consider it of special interest to delve deeper into the moderating variables of the relationship between alcohol abuse and physical violence in adolescents. Research interest in this population has focused on alcohol abuse at this stage of development and with the beginning of intimate partner relationships, as well as the presence of violence in these relationships [34]. Violence can be particularly severe in adolescence, especially at the beginning of intimate personal relationships [2,3].In addition, there exists considerable literature indicating that both alcohol abuse and physical violence towards partners depend on both gender and age [35,36]. Therefore, in our aim to explore the moderating role of emotional regulation between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards partners, we will do so differentially according to the gender and age of the participants. To our knowledge, these relationships have not been explored.Our bivariate results support the existing literature indicating a higher incidence of both problem behaviours (alcohol abuse and intimate partner violence) in men than in women. Research indicates that excessive alcohol abuse is higher in male adolescents than in female adolescents [37,38,39,40]. Our results support the higher risk profile in males, regardless of the age. With regard to physical violence towards intimate partners, our data are also in line with the previous research, which shows higher scores for men [41].Regarding the central variable of our research, initial bivariate results indicate differences in the use of emotional dysregulation strategies between men and women. This fact has been sufficiently investigated in the previous literature [42,43]. Specifically, our findings point to a greater lack of emotional awareness in males as in previous studies [44], in line with a higher prevalence of alexithymia in males [45].On the other hand, with respect to the difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviours, our results, as observed in previous studies [46], show higher scores in women.In relation to the main objective of our research, one finding of interest is that despite the introduction of the different emotional dysregulation strategies as moderating variables, there is still a direct effect of excessive alcohol consumption on physical violence in both adolescent males and females. This direct relationship holds in all cases, irrespective of the emotional dysregulation strategy and in both males and females. This fact is particularly relevant and has important practical implications. The amplifying/buffering role of emotional (dys)regulation strategies in the relationship between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards one’s partner does not negate the direct effect between these problematic behaviours highlighted in the previous literature [20,25,26].Of particular interest in our study is the age differential between men and women, where the effect of alcohol abuse on physical violence towards partners is significant. Thus, while in male adolescents, alcohol abuse only has a direct effect on physical violence towards partners from the age of 16, in the case of females, this effect is observed at earlier stages (pre-adolescence, 14–15 years). Previous studies [47,48] have already pointed out that alcohol abuse begins in many cases in pre-adolescence, with the onset of poly-drug use patterns (including other drugs and not only alcohol) being observed from the age of 16. This alcohol abuse has been associated, in the case of men, with a marked increase in the likelihood of perpetrating a physical assault compared to non-drinkers [49]. However, there are few previous studies that delve into a differential analysis between men and women [15] and to our knowledge, there are none that also consider emotional dysregulation. This is why our findings point to the need to intervene, especially early on in alcohol abuse in adolescent women, in order to prevent physical violence against partners.In the analysis of the effects of emotional dysregulation strategies on physical violence, the results obtained point to direct effects in both male and female adolescents. It is of additional interest that this effect is observed in both males and females in the 16–18 years age group, but not in early adolescence (14–15 years). Likewise, the results indicate that in the group of 16–18-year-old males, all emotional dysregulation strategies have a direct effect on physical violence against partners, while in females of the same age, the effect is more selective (not affecting all strategies). Thus, in the case of women, these direct effects involve maladaptive strategies such as impulsivity, which represent a key strategy in explaining dating violence, nonacceptance, a lack of goals, and a lack of strategies [50,51,52,53]. Although to our knowledge, there are no previous studies that analyse these relationships in adolescents differentiated by age and gender, our data as a whole (except in the case of “lack of emotional awareness”) indicate that better emotional regulation leads to a lower perpetration of violence, consistent with the previous literature [44,54]. According to the models of emotional regulation proposed by Gross (1999) [13] and Hervás (2011) [14], the impact of emotional regulation strategies on violent behaviours observed in adolescents can be better understood. Gross [13] (1999) classifies emotional regulation strategies as adaptive and maladaptive, such as cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression, respectively. Hervás [14] (2011) highlights the importance of self-regulation and self-reflection in emotional regulation, especially in the component of emotional modulation. These components are particularly relevant in late adolescence given that, as mentioned, maladaptive strategies such as impulsivity or a lack of emotional acceptance in females and the combination of several strategies in males may enhance physical violence in relationships. Thus, the promotion of emotional regulation strategies would be essential to reduce these aggressive behaviours.A particularly striking result observed in males is the effect of “lack of emotional awareness” on physical violence towards a partner. Somewhat counter-intuitively a priori, it seems that high levels of this dysregulation strategy, in contrast to the rest of the strategies, are related to less physical violence. Given the lack of previous research on this topic, some questions could be hypothesised to try to explain these results. On the one hand, it could be argued that showing an excess of emotional awareness could be detrimental, since emotions regulate people’s behaviour and their strength drives actions [55,56]. People tend to internalise and want to achieve social expectations, which when not achieved causes them to experience a series of negative feelings or emotions in search of balance in the situation. Being fully aware of and ruminating on this anguish, helplessness, or despair can sometimes lead to violent behaviour [55]. In this sense, studies analysing the different role of emotional intelligence dimensions have confirmed the not-always-healthy role of high levels of emotional attention, as opposed to repair and emotional clarity [57]. On the other hand, it is necessary to take into account the contextual variables where the present data have to be interpreted, namely the adolescence stage. Thus, it should be taken into account that this excess of emotional awareness, in the present study, occurs at a stage in which the acquisition of adaptive emotional regulation strategies is not always a reality. As is well known, emotional regulation is a complex process that is acquired from childhood, guided by adults in the family and the school environment until adolescence, where emotions are understood in a more individualised and complex way due to the development of cognitive skills [58]. Having reached this stage with better tools at the level of emotion regulation will influence experiencing greater subjective well-being, comfort or satisfaction with oneself, being able to regulate oneself better and presenting more socially appropriate behaviours, and having a lower probability of displaying problematic behaviours in adolescence and later life stages [58,59,60]. The lack of adaptive strategies for coping with various situations, enhanced by an excess of emotional awareness, could lead to the use of violence as the only option for dealing with them [24,50,51]. Along the same lines and without leaving contextual variables aside, it is known that at this stage, peer pressure and social pressure play a fundamental role as predictors of behaviour [61,62,63]. At an evolutionary stage where adaptive regulation strategies are not particularly consolidated [64] and where violence as a means of regulation is socially reinforced [65,66], it could be understood that an excess of emotional awareness is associated with a greater intensity of physical violence towards partners. Certain explanatory theories such as Bandura’s (1977) [9] social theory and processes such as the intergenerational transmission of violence [10] may contribute to the learning and maintenance of violence, which in turn may be reinforced by peers in the school environment or outside it [59,67,68,69,70].Finally, it is relevant to point out one of the most novel results of the present study. In particular, we refer to the moderation effects found in the group of women aged 16–18 years, with regard to certain strategies of emotional dysregulation between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards partners. Specifically, “Impulse control difficulties”, “Nonacceptance of emotional responses”, and “limited access to emotion regulation strategies” are shown to be strategies that at high levels (i.e., high dysregulation) favour a significant and positive relationship between alcohol abuse and physical violence. As has been pointed out, although the role of these maladaptive strategies has been discussed in relation to physical violence and violent behaviour, bidirectional relationships have been explored, especially in relation to impulsivity [71,72], without considering their possible moderating role and without delving into the differential effects according to gender or age. Given the relevance that these results may have for personalised treatments from models of psychological flexibility [73], it would be of interest to conduct further studies that delve into these relationships. In the case of “lack of emotional awareness”, the apparent counter-intuitive effect, previously mentioned regarding its direct effect on physical violence in men, is once again observed, in this case in relation to its moderating role. In the absence of previous studies in this regard, as mentioned above, the results obtained (direct effect on males, moderating effect on females) point to the need for a differential analysis of the “emotional awareness” strategy due to its complexity and the adaptive and maladaptive results to which it may be associated, probably explained by its combination with other contextual variables or other regulatory mechanisms.Practical ImplicationsDespite the moderating influence of emotional regulation, a direct relationship persists between alcohol consumption and violent behaviour toward one’s partner. Problematic alcohol consumption is considered one of the main risk factors for violence [74,75], while the sale of alcohol has shown a positive and significant correlation with general homicide rates in several countries, such as those in Europe and India [76,77,78]. According to the WHO [79] (2009), interventions aimed at preventing alcohol-related violence could contribute to the reduction in various forms of violence, including intimate partner violence, child abuse, and suicide. In the systematic review by [80], which analysed 13 prevention programmes for interpersonal violence occurring under the influence of alcohol, it was highlighted that interventions targeting the perpetrators of violence (especially males), particularly those with a family-focused approach, have proven more effective in reducing intimate partner violence. This suggests that addressing alcohol consumption in this context could be a useful strategy. On the other hand, the systematic review conducted by McMurran et al. (2011) [81], aimed at determining the best interventions to prevent violence under alcohol consumption by women, found that some studies suggested potential negative effects of these interventions, while others showed short-term benefits (up to 6 months), but without lasting effects. Additionally, it was suggested that women may experience emotional issues leading to excessive alcohol consumption, and interventions that induce negative emotions could increase emotional distress, thereby exacerbating drinking behaviour and the likelihood of alcohol-related offences. Regarding types of interventions, it seems that those carried out online may be effective in reducing alcohol-related intimate partner violence in young people and adolescents [82,83] though further research is needed to obtain conclusive results [84].Moreover, given the important role of emotional regulation as a moderating variable between alcohol consumption and violence, there is a clear need to implement strategies and programmes that provide tools for improving emotional management. In this regard, prevention programmes in schools, such as the RULER program [85,86] and INTEMO [87,88], have shown positive results in terms of effectiveness. It is crucial to strengthen those elements related to emotional intelligence that act as protective factors against violent behaviour, such as emotional management and empathy [89].This study has some limitations that should be mentioned. First, the data are based on a cross-sectional design, so it is not possible to establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Second, adolescents that participated were recruited voluntarily in a single province, which could be limiting representativity; therefore, generalisation of the data to the general adolescent population could be compromised. Another limitation is the reliability of data obtained through self-reported measures. Specifically, when these instruments are used to assess negative variables (alcohol abuse, physical violence towards partners), participants are more likely to be biassed in their responses. Finally, although we have included important psychological mechanisms in intimate partner violence (i.e., alcohol abuse, emotional dysregulation), the list is not complete. Thus, given that the highest percentage of variance explained in our research is 30%, it would be of interest for future research to explore the role of other relevant psychosocial variables such as self-esteem, social support, self-efficacy, empathy, social skill deficits, or attachment.Despite the above limitations, the results of our study provide new data to understand the complex relationship between alcohol abuse and physical violence towards partners, considering the role of non-adaptive emotional regulation processes. The data highlight the need to personalise treatments and/or preventive measures according to gender and age in the adolescent population.Thus, in the case of male adolescents, the critical age is set to 16 years of age, where both alcohol abuse and emotional dysregulation strategies seem to play a significant role in physical violence towards partners. In the case of female adolescents, two differential profiles can be observed depending on their age. In the early stage (14–15 years), a significant effect of alcohol abuse on intimate partner violence is observed, but from the age of 16, in addition to alcohol, emotional dysregulation strategies play a direct effect and moderation effects are also observed in the alcohol abuse–physical violence relationship depending on the levels of emotional dysregulation.Finally, emotional awareness does not seem a priori to be an adaptive strategy in this context. We expect that the present study will inspire future similar investigations including these and other important psychological processes, such as self-efficacy, coping, and acceptance, to name some examples. It is necessary, given the high prevalence of violent behaviour in the adolescent population [90,91,92] to increase the body of knowledge in this regard in order to design and carry out prevention and intervention programmes with groups of adolescents at risk of carrying out this type of violent behaviour."

        "Abstract": "AbstractTeam sports require athletes’ exceptional perceptual-cognitive skills, such as anticipation and decision-making. Perceptual-cognitive training in laboratories aims to enhance these abilities. However, its effectiveness in real-game performance remains controversial, necessitating a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine optimal training methods. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we searched databases (e.g., PubMed, WOS, Scopus, and EBSCO) for relevant studies published before November 2023, assessed study quality, extracted important characteristics, and conducted a meta-analysis using Stata 15.1. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023494324). A total of 22 quantitative studies involving 45 effect sizes were included. Perceptual-cognitive training positively influenced elite athletes’ anticipation and decision-making. However, its transfer effect on real-game performance improvement (ES= 0.65) was inferior to laboratory performance improvement (ES= 1.51). Sub-group analyses indicated that the effects of training interventions varied based on stimulus presentation and intervention duration. Based on our findings, we concluded that while perceptual-cognitive training improved on-court performance, its transfer effects were limited. To maximize effectiveness, future interventions should use virtual reality to present training stimuli and incorporate participants’ sport-specific responses to reflect real-game scenarios.Keywords:perceptual-cognitive training, on-court transfer effect, optimal training methods, decision-making and anticipation, meta-analysis",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionTeam sports involve intense rivalry and intricate tactical interactions. In the dynamic and open environment of a game, athletes must continuously monitor and adapt to rapidly changing conditions, such as positional relationships between teammates and opponents, and respond appropriately within a constrained timeframe based on the current situation [1,2]. Elite athletes require outstanding perceptual-cognitive abilities, including advanced anticipation and decision-making skills, to navigate the rapid pace and intensity of team sports [3]. Anticipation denotes the ability to discern the outcome of opponents’ actions prior to their execution, such as predicting the direction of a volleyball spike [4]. Decision-making involves identifying and synthesizing environmental cues using existing knowledge to generate effective actions in dynamic competitive environments [5]. These two skills enable athletes to respond appropriately, resulting in excellent sports performance [6]. Expert–novice studies indicated that elite athletes both outperform novices in real games and demonstrate superior cognitive skills in laboratory-based sports-specific cognitive tasks [7], as evidenced by their higher accuracy and faster response times [8].Currently, athletes’ tactical knowledge and decision-making skills improve primarily through self-learning experiences during on-court training and competition [9]. However, on-court training has drawbacks: it requires high-intensity activity and is physically demanding. This could lead to unnecessary fatigue and injuries. Additionally, the variable and uncontrollable nature of in-game scenarios makes it challenging to isolate specific decision-making situations [10]. To overcome these limitations and effectively improve athletes’ cognitive skills, numerous studies have examined whether isolated laboratory-based cognitive training can improve athletes’ anticipation and decision-making and whether these improvements can be transferred to actual competition performance [11]. In laboratory settings, decision-making training takes various forms [12]. Among these, the most prevalent and effective method is perceptual-cognitive training, especially video-based training [13], in which videos are used to display stimuli or sports scenarios that necessitate participants’ perceptual reactions [14]. Through video-based training, coaches can control specific anticipation decision-making scenarios to effectively improve athletes’ tactical knowledge and develop their attention toward pertinent perceptual cues [10]. Three-dimensional multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) training is a visual training form aimed at improving visual attention, information processing speed, and working memory [7], which are critical for team sports performance. To be sure, 3D-MOT tasks can effectively replicate real-game scenarios. For example, in team sports such as soccer or basketball, during offensive and defensive play, athletes need to simultaneously monitor and process the positions and movements of multiple opponents and teammates. Moreover, the correlation between 3D-MOT and real-game performance has been strongly demonstrated [7], affirming the efficacy of this training.Current intervention studies consistently indicate that isolated perceptual-cognitive training can effectively enhance athletes’ cognitive skills in laboratory-based tasks. However, conclusions regarding the effectiveness of transferring these skills to on-court performance (the transfer effect) remain controversial [7]. The ultimate goal of such training is to improve athletic performance effectively in real competitions. Therefore, investigating whether the transfer effect exists and exploring optimal methods to train transfer performance are crucial focuses for sports training and research. Theoretically, scholars generally agree that the representativeness of the training-provided stimulus in real-game competition scenarios (i.e., ecological validity) is crucial for the on-court transfer effect [15]. The Modified Perceptual Training Framework (MPTF), proposed by Hadlow, is a widely recognized classic model based on representative learning design [16]. This framework suggests that the following three ecological factors could influence the transfer effect of perceptual training: the targeted ability of the training must correspond to the perceptual-cognitive functions required in real competitions; the stimuli videos used during training should resemble the scenarios athletes encounter in actual competitions; and the responses required during training should closely align with those required on the court, demanding athletes perform specific actions such as defensive movement to the left or right, passing, shooting, or hitting the ball [17].Numerous experimental intervention studies have tested the transfer effectiveness of perceptual-cognitive training; however, the findings are controversial, typically because of small sample sizes. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis are necessary to pool data and provide a more robust assessment of training effectiveness [12]. Previous systematic reviews demonstrated significant positive effects of training on laboratory-based anticipation and decision-making skills. However, these reviews had some limitations. First, rather than analyzing on-court transfer performance and laboratory-based scores as separate outcome measures, they only considered laboratory decision-making performance or conflated the two [12]. Second, some reviews only focused on a particular sport [11], resulting in a limited number of studies. Third, some studies lacked a quantitative meta-analysis, offering only qualitative systematic reviews [10,14].To address these limitations, this review assessed whether improvements in anticipation and decision-making from perceptual-cognitive training in elite athletes could be transferred to on-court sports performance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, including both randomized controlled trials (RCT) and non-randomized studies (NRS), to quantitatively explore the transfer effect of this type of training. Further, we systematically extracted and categorized the characteristics of each study using a characteristic table and conducted a series of sub-group meta-analyses to investigate how different characteristics, such as ecological factors, influence transfer effects. Through our analyses and discussions, we aimed to identify the optimal intervention form, guide future research, and provide practical recommendations for future perceptual-cognitive training in elite athletes. 2. Materials and MethodsIn our systematic review and meta-analysis, we followed the guidelines of the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) checklist [18] (Table S1). This systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42023494324).2.1. Search StrategyIn November 2023, after summarizing keywords from previous reviews [10,11,12] and discussions, we ultimately determined the search strategy used to retrieve relevant studies using various databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and PsychInfo (via EBSCO). Following the population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) approach, the search strategy included participants, interventions, and study types. The search criteria included full-text availability, publication date, and language (Appendix A). The reference lists of the included studies were manually reviewed to identify additional suitable studies.2.2. Selection CriteriaAfter conducting the literature search, we imported the retrieved studies into reference manager software (Zotero 6.1) and removed duplicate entries. Two authors (Zhu R. and Zheng M.) independently reviewed all the articles. Non-relevant studies were initially excluded by screening titles and abstracts and downloading the full texts of potentially suitable articles [19]. More noncompliant studies were excluded after reading the full text. Upon completing the independent review, the reviewers sought to reach a consensus concerning which studies would be included. In cases of disagreement, a third reviewer (Cao C.) was consulted to make a final decision. Ultimately, all three reviewers agreed on the final selection of studies.2.2.1. Inclusion CriteriaInclusion criteria were developed according to PICOS study design principles [20,21]:Participants: Elite team sports athletes with more than three years of team sports experience, not limited to age.Interventions: Participants underwent cognitive-perceptual training (such as MOT or video-based training) programs to develop sports-specific anticipation or decision-making skills.Comparators: Control groups (passive control, no extra training except regular on-field training) or placebo groups (active control, watching videos of the same duration as training groups, but not performing meaningful training).Outcomes: At least one of the following indicators—laboratory task-specific response accuracy (RA), response time (RT), or on-court transfer RA/performance RT.Study design: RCT with pre-tests and post-tests or NRS with pre-tests and post-tests.2.2.2. Exclusion CriteriaWe excluded studies based on the following characteristics:Participants were individual sportspersons or beginners who had not participated in professional training or official events;The intervention group received on-field training (such as a mini-tournament or small-sided game) rather than cognitive-perceptual training;The study lacked a control/placebo group;The full text was not available, the study data (pre-test and post-test mean [M] and standard deviation [SD]) could not be extracted and calculated, and the data remained unavailable after contacting the corresponding authors;Qualitative research, reviews, non-intervention studies, dissertations, and conference papers.2.3. Data ExtractionTwo researchers (Zhu R. and Zheng M.) independently extracted the attributes and data of the included studies and recorded them in a pre-established standardized table following the PICOS methodology. Where necessary, a third senior researcher (Cao C.) was consulted to validate the decisions taken.2.4. Assessment of Methodological Quality and HeterogeneityThe researchers independently evaluated the methodological rigor and potential bias of all the studies. We employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool [22] in Revman5.3 software for the 14 included RCT studies. The risk of bias was assessed for seven criteria, and each criterion was rated as low, unclear, or high risk, culminating in the creation of RoB graphs (Figure 1). The results indicated that owing to insufficient rigor in the methodology, there was publication bias in the included studies. Regarding selection bias, only two studies provided detailed descriptions of how random sequence generation and allocation concealment were conducted, with most other studies having at least one aspect with an unclear or high risk of bias. Second, seven studies did not consider double blinding, potentially resulting in a high risk of detection bias. Four studies did not explain the reasons for participants’ high dropout rates, causing risks of attrition bias. Three studies selectively reported data for some outcomes—for example, reporting only F- orp-values—resulting in a high or unclear risk of reporting bias.For NRS, the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool [23] was used to assess the potential bias by consulting prior research [12]. This assessment tool comprises three dimensions: pre-, at-, and post-intervention bias. The overall risk of bias for each study was determined and categorized as low, moderate, or critical, as summarized in the ROBINS-I tables (Table 1). Overall, three studies were rated as critical risk, four as moderate risk, and one as low risk.Additionally, we used funnel plots to depict heterogeneity intuitively among the included studies (Appendix B), which showed that some dots were outside the dashed line, indicating heterogeneity among the studies, especially for outcomes like task-specific RA and on-court transfer RA. The sensitivity of the analysis was assessed using trim plots (Appendix C), which showed that none of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) deviated from the original intervals, indicating that our meta-analysis was stable.Figure 1.Open in a new tabCochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) graphs of the RCT studies.

Summary Measures and Effect Size (ES) CalculationTo quantify the effects of perceptual-cognitive training on anticipation and decision-making skills, we conducted a meta-analysis using Stata SE 15.1 software, which primarily focused on four main outcomes: athletes’ decision RA and RT in laboratory-based tasks, as well as the on-court transfer of RA and RT to the real sports competition. M and SD values of the pre- and post-intervention tests were calculated. Corresponding values reported directly in the text were preferred. If unavailable, we estimated values from other reported data or those obtained by contacting the corresponding author; articles or data that could not be obtained were excluded. Because pre-test values may differ among different groups in some studies, rather than solely relying on post-test values, we calculated pre- and post-test differences (mean difference, MD) and their standard deviation (SDMD) by adhering to the formulas recommended by the Cochrane guidelines [22] for each group and included this in the meta-analysis.Stata SE 15.1 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis because of the large variation in the mean values of the outcomes and the small sample size of the included studies. We adjusted for bias when calculating effect sizes using Hedges’ g, expressed as effects size (ES) with 95% CIs [44,45]. The ESs were categorized as small (0.2), medium (0.5), or large (0.8) based on their absolute values [46]. The heterogeneity was tested, with I-squared (I2) < 50% indicating low heterogeneity andI2> 50% indicating high heterogeneity [47,48]. Since the research papers included in this study involved various sports, there was inherent heterogeneity among the studies. Therefore, we uniformly used a random-effects model for analysis.2.5.2. Sub-Group AnalysisWe used Stata SE 15.1 software for sub-group effects analysis for on-court transfer RA, which was undertaken to investigate whether the impact of the intervention on on-court transfer decision-making abilities was attributable to varying training characteristics such as age, stimulus presentation equipment type (computer screen, life-size projector screen, or 3D/virtual reality [VR] device), required response (verbal response or sport-specific action response), duration of the entire intervention (≤4 weeks or >4 weeks), or frequency (<3 sessions/week or ≥3 sessions/week). 3.

Marked with an asterisk (*) means that the outcome data from this group were used in the meta-analysis.3.2.1. ParticipantsRelevant studies have examined various sports teams (Table 2). Among these, soccer garnered the most attention, with seven included studies. This is likely because of the popularity of soccer and its extensive research resources. Additionally, soccer involves complex tactics requiring superior perceptual-cognitive skills [7,33]. Rugby ranked second in the number of studies included, with four articles. According to expertise levels, participants in the included studies met the experience standards of elite athletes: one study focused on international-level athletes, seven studies focused on national-level athletes, five focused on professional-level athletes, six focused on university- or high-school-level athletes, and three focused on club-level athletes. Regarding sex and age, four studies focused solely on female athletes, ten focused solely on male athletes, and eight focused on both or did not report specific sex. Thirteen studies targeted adults (>18 years), whereas nine focused on young athletes (14–18 years).3.2.2. Intervention vs. ComparisonFor the intervention forms (Table 3), the types of stimulus presentation can be divided into three main categories: seven computer videos, eight projectors for life-size videos, and seven VR devices for immersive stimuli. Regarding the response type, 11 studies required verbal responses or keyboard clicking, and 11 required specific action responses, which more closely simulated real scenarios. Additionally, owing to the absence of standardized scientific guidelines for cognitive-perceptual training [28], there were variations in duration and frequency across different interventions. The included studies indicated that the total intervention periods ranged from 1 to 8 weeks, with frequencies varying from once a week to seven times a week, and each session lasted between 5 and 45 min. For comparison, some studies established a placebo group by having participants watch ordinary competition videos [29,31] or engage in non-sports cognitive tasks [17,25], whereas others only set up a negative control group with no intervention.3.2.3. On-Court Transfer MeasurementTwo primary methods were employed (Table 2) to measure on-court transfer abilities. The first method directly transformed video stimuli into actual situations and calculated their success rates in a real court [38]. The second method involved placing participants in small-sided games [33] in which coaches used coding instruments to assess player decision-making skills quantitatively.3.3. Total ES: Intervention vs. Control/PlaceboAmong the 22 studies included in this systematic review, 17 provided task-specific RA (pooledn= 381), 13 provided on-court transfer RA (pooledn= 247), 8 provided task-specific RT (pooledn= 130), and 7 provided on-court transfer RT (pooledn= 139).Figure 3illustrates the effects of training on these four outcomes. There was a large effect (ES = 1.51, 95% CI = [0.98, 2.05],I2= 78.7%) for task-specific RA (upper left) but only a medium-sized effect (ES = 0.65, 95% CI = [0.15, 1.16],I2= 71.4%) for on-court transfer RA (upper right). As a shorter RT may indicate better cognitive skills, the ESs were usually negative. Therefore, we considered the absolute value of the ES for RT. For task-specific RT (lower left), the ES was large (ES = −0.91, 95% CI = [−1.45, −0.38],I2= 48.0%), favoring the intervention groups, and there was only a close to medium ES (ES = −0.44, 95% CI = [−0.81, −0.06],I2= 13.8%) for on-court transfer RT (lower right).Figure 3.Open in a new tabForest plots depicting the total effect size (ES) of interventions on four outcomes.

AgeFor transfer RA, there were medium-sized effects for both adult (ES = 0.63, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.98],I2= 0.0%) and adolescent (ES = 0.58, 95% CI = [−0.65, 1.82],I2= 88.7%) groups, with no significant heterogeneity between them (p= 0.939).3.4.2. Ecological Factors Affecting the InterventionThe effects of different ecological training factors on RA transfer are shown inFigure 4. The ESs on transfer RA differed among the stimulus types, but the difference was not significant (p= 0.449). For computer videos, there was only a small-sized effect (ES = 0.19, 95% CI = [−0.56, 0.94],I2= 19.0%). For life-size videos, there was a close to medium-sized effect (ES = 0.46, 95% CI = [−0.08, 1.00],I2= 19.5%). For 3D/VR training, the ES was significantly larger (ES = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.02, 1.89],I2= 84.7%).Figure 4.Open in a new tabSub-group analyses testing the different transfer effects of intervention among different stimuli types or response types. Notes: RA, response accuracy; RT, response time; CI, confidence interval [7,17,24,25,26,33,34,35,36,37,38,42,43].It is universally acknowledged that participants’ responses to stimuli may also influence the transfer effect. For transfer RA, the ES was small (ES = 0.41, 95% CI = [0.07, 0.75],I2= 2.2%) when participants’ verbal responses were required; however, there was a large effect (ES = 0.87, 95% CI = [−0.22, 1.96],I2= 84.5%) when sports-specific action responses were required. However, no significant heterogeneity was observed among the different response types (p= 0.429).3.4.3. Duration and Frequency of Training InterventionsFigure 5(left side) indicates that studies with longer training periods had a larger effect on transfer RA (≤4 weeks: ES = 0.38, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.74],I2= 22.8%; >4 weeks: ES = 1.25, 95% CI = [−0.16, 2.65],I2= 87.8%) but the difference was not significant (p= 0.241). For each session (Figure 5, middle section), the effect was medium for both shorter (<20 min: ES = 0.56, 95% CI = [0.01, 1.11],I2= 42.8%) and longer (>20 min: ES = 0.72, 95% CI = [−0.10, 1.54],I2= 81.8%) durations. For the training frequencies (Figure 5, right side), the ESs were similar for both groups (<3 sessions/week: ES = 0.72, 95% CI = [−0.10, 1.54],I2= 81.8%, ≥3: ES = 0.56, 95% CI = [0.01, 1.11],I2= 42.8%).Figure 5.Open in a new tabSub-group analyses testing the different effects among different durations of whole training periods (left side), frequency of intervention (middle section), and each session duration (right side).

DiscussionThis study systematically reviewed the scientific literature on the effects of perceptual-cognitive training on elite athletes’ anticipation and decision-making skills. Overall, the intervention groups showed significant improvements in both RA and RT compared with the control groups, both in laboratory-based tasks and on-court performance, which aligns with previous findings [10,12]. This type of training targets sports-specific tactical situations [50] and guides athletes to accurately capture the most critical information in the environment at optimal moments, thereby enhancing their ability to respond correctly in shorter times [51,52]. However, while training had a large effect on laboratory-based outcomes, it only showed medium-sized effects on transfer outcomes, indicating that while perceptual-cognitive training can enhance real-game decision-making performance to some extent, its transfer effects may be limited.4.1. Ecological Factors: Key Influences on Training Transfer EffectivenessThe MPTF [16,53] posits that the representativeness and ecological validity of perceptual training are crucial for transfer effectiveness [7]. Therefore, we conducted sub-group analyses to explore how different ecological factors in intervention training influence the transfer effect. Our findings support the MPTF.First, the included studies aimed to improve the decision-making skills required in competition, in line with the first aim of the MPTF. Second, regarding the stimulus presentation type, the transfer effect increased when stimulus fidelity was higher. In early perceptual training, computer screens were commonly used as stimulus presentation devices [17,37]; however, the results indicated that computer video training produced the smallest transfer effects. This could be owing to the small size of the screens, which failed to adequately simulate real-game environments [28]. Subsequent studies have used projectors to display life-size 2D videos, yielding a medium-sized transfer effect [26,31]. In the 2D life-size video training, the most effective type of training stimuli was the “first-person perspective” video, created by equipping a player with a head-mounted sports camera to capture their view of the court [10,35]. This approach significantly outperformed third-person perspective videos shot from fixed positions on the court [4], since first-person videos better simulate the actual visual situation on the court, helping participants develop better self-perception [54]. With technological improvements, 3D and VR devices have been introduced in perceptual training [33,42] to create simulated real-game settings, offering an immersive, multisensory environment that allows athletes to engage interactively [55,56]. Our sub-group analysis results indicated the highest transfer effect for studies using 3D and VR devices. For instance, some studies had participants wear head-mounted VR devices and watch and respond to videos of offensive decision-making scenarios taken from the first-person perspective of basketball players [35]. Other studies involved participants watching immersive 3D circular screen videos or engaging in 3D-MOT tasks [7,36]. Using VR devices to display first-person perspectives provided the most realistic visual simulation of actual competition [10]. Finally, our findings demonstrated that training incorporating sports-specific movement responses is more effective in enhancing transfer performance compared to training that only requires verbal responses. This is because sports-specific action responses during training can enhance perception-action coupling [57], thereby enabling participants to apply the skills acquired in training more effectively in real competitive scenarios, resulting in quicker and more accurate responses [58].Regarding training duration and frequency, when the total training period exceeded 4 weeks, it was more effective. Conversely, acute intervention was less effective. This accords with previous findings [11]. Although some previous studies indicate that twice-weekly training interventions are more effective, our results did not show any differences at different frequencies. Interestingly, we observed a correlation between frequency and single-session duration, with studies tending to have longer single-session training durations (≥20 min) when the frequency of the intervention was low (<3 sessions/week), which we speculate was to ensure that the total training duration per week was at a similarly reasonable level. Additionally, interventions with a single training session duration (5–10 min) were too short to be effective [41,42].4.2. Comparative Characteristic Summary of the Details of Other Training ProceduresTemporal occlusion is frequently employed in video training, wherein videos are paused at a certain frame before the athlete’s action, requiring immediate participant responses, rather than playing through to completion [53]. This approach helps develop athletes’ perceptual-cognitive patterns as they can efficiently capture early critical information, significantly improving both the accuracy and timeliness of their responses [59,60]. Offensive decision-making requires players to judge and execute tactics in a complex, dynamic environment [61]. Typically, only a single temporal occlusion point set just before a decision is required for offensive decision-making training to display complete tactical information that aids accurate decision-making [28,37]. However, defensive players must focus on their opponent’s physical kinesiology-related information to anticipate their possible intentions [6,8], and experts can anticipate opponents’ actions earlier than novices [4,62]. In a training study [25] on softball batting direction prediction, three temporally occluded videos were set up, including pre-contact, during-contact, and post-contact, to train participants to progressively capture essential information earlier. Alsharji [31] employed both spatial and temporal occlusion techniques to enhance training in anticipation skills among handball athletes. The performance of the intervention groups in these two studies improved significantly, indicating that employing multiple types of occlusion videos may further enhance anticipation skills.Some studies have used an explicit instructional approach to help participants pay attention to key information in video stimuli by providing instructions during training [24]. Instructions can take various forms, such as using arrows to point to relevant areas during video play [24,27,41] or directing attention through verbal instruction before video play [17,37]. In contrast, in the implicit training approach, participants received no instructions and relied on their perceptions to identify relevant information [63]. Some studies compared explicit and implicit interventions [17,41] and found no significant difference between the two forms in enhancing the ability to recognize and process task information [52,64].Most interventions typically used fixed-speed video stimuli; however, there were some exceptions. Some studies used 1.5× more real-time videos [28] to train defensive anticipation skills. They found that accelerated video training was more effective for overall ability improvement and long-term retention (after 10 weeks) than regular-speed video training. A speed of 1.5 may be optimal for video training, as it increases the urgency of tasks, forcing athletes to respond more automatically and with less time for information processing, thereby enhancing their on-court urgent response [65]. Further, 3D-MOT [33,36] and some 3D video training [34] used adaptive training techniques, adjusting the stimulus speed through a staircase procedure based on participants’ RA during training. This training method better simulates different conditions that may be encountered in a real game, prompting participants to explore the perceptual-motor space more deeply [66,67].Our results did not show any differences in the transfer effects between adults and adolescents. A critical stage of decision-making skill development occurs during early adolescence [12,68] and adolescents will reach a stable and practically effective level at 15 years of age [69]. The young participants included in that study were elite athletes with significant training experience. Additionally, they were primarily older than 15 years, at which time their tactical decision-making skills may be developing at a rate close to that of adults. This could explain the non-significant differences between them and adults in terms of training effects [12].4.3. Limitations of Existing Studies and This ReviewMost of the included studies involved training using computer videos that did not involve an on-court transfer test. Additionally, only a limited number of studies could be included in the meta-analysis of on-court transfer outcomes [69]. Accordingly, our discussion on the training transfer effect of computer videos was relatively limited [16], which may have led to high meta-analysis estimates of the total ESs. Only half of the reviewed studies included a placebo group to control for the intervention expectancy effect, thus ensuring objectivity [69,70,71]. A retention test is crucial because it can determine whether there is a potential sustained effect of the training [10,72]; however, only seven of the included studies established retention tests, and the time points of the retention tests were not unified. The reporting of outcome data (e.g., M or SD) in some studies was not standardized, which could cause inconvenience or estimation bias in future quantitative meta-analyses. Overall, there has been a lack of standardization and a high risk of bias in the methodological design used in current intervention studies.This systematic review had some limitations. It only included the literature written in English; therefore, relevant studies written in other languages were not analyzed. Additionally, to extract more consistent outcome metrics (in terms of RA/RT), our review focused mainly on perceptual-cognitive training and ignored training related to tactical reflection and understanding [12], such as self-questioning [73] and imagery training [74]. Finally, our meta-analysis results need to be interpreted with caution because of heterogeneity in study design and methodological quality among the included studies, which may explain why we observed trends in sub-group analyses but non-significantp-values.4.4. Future Research and Practical Training ApplicationBased on the results, we offer the following suggestions for future practical training applications. Perceptual-cognitive training should focus on the fidelity of training stimuli. VR devices should be used to play videos from a first-person perspective and require athletes to respond to sports movements. This type of training was the most effective. We suggest that the total training period should be more than four weeks, with approximately two to four sessions per week, and each session should last between 10 and 25 min. This type of intervention should be performed regularly on athletes to prevent possible recessionary effects."

        "Title": "“SHIELDing” Our Educators: Comprehensive Coping Strategies for Teacher Occupational Well-Being",
        "Abstract": "AbstractBackground: Teaching is a physically and mentally challenging profession that demands high emotional involvement, often leading to stress and anxiety. Understanding how teachers cope with these demands is essential for enhancing their well-being and effectiveness. Objectives: This study aimed to (1) investigate personal and school-based well-being initiatives that teachers use for maintaining their occupational well-being, and (2) develop a coping strategy model that enhances teachers’ occupational well-being. Methods: This study utilised a qualitative phenomenological approach to explore the coping strategies of Australian primary school teachers. Results: The twenty-one participants interviewed employed ten diverse coping strategies classified into five personal and five school-based well-being-enabling initiatives. The personal strategies included setting boundaries, exercise and physical health, social support and interactions, mental health and mindfulness, and work–life balance. The school-based initiatives comprised supportive leadership, colleague support, flexibility and autonomy, resource availability, and proactive approaches to address challenges. A novel SHIELD model incorporating Support, Health, Interaction, Empathy, Leadership, and Development strategies was formulated as a holistic coping strategy for enhancing teachers’ occupational well-being. Conclusions: The findings highlight the necessity of a holistic approach to teacher well-being, integrating both personal and institutional support systems. Schools can enhance teacher well-being by fostering a supportive and empathetic culture, providing necessary resources, and encouraging healthy lifestyles. The SHIELD model offers a comprehensive framework for supporting teachers and improving educational outcomes.Keywords:coping strategies, stress, teacher well-being, collaboration, social support",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionTeaching is a profession that comes with numerous expectations and requirements, set not only by the teachers themselves but also by schools, governments, and other stakeholders [1]. Teachers face a multitude of demands that can result in stress and emotional exhaustion, contributing to a health impairment process [2]. Despite teachers significantly influencing students’ holistic learning, progress, and academic performance [3,4,5], the teaching profession has been reported to be very stressful [6], due to its association with enormous stress, fatigue, and burnout [7]. High levels of teacher occupational stress have been documented globally [3,4,6] and within Australia [3,8], which is the focus of this study. The findings suggest that administrative tasks are a greater source of stress for teachers than classroom teaching hours. Australian teachers, like their international counterparts, spend an average of 19 h teaching, 7 h planning, and 5 h marking each week [3,8]. However, Australian teachers work an average of 43 h per week, which is 5 h more than the global average [3,8,9].Stress in teachers arises when classroom demands exceed their perceived capacity to cope [10]. This stress impacts their performance globally and is one of the main causes of burnout [5]. Consequently, scholars emphasise the need for approaches to help teachers cope with anxiety [11,12]. The experience of stress among teachers depends on the interaction of personality traits, developed skills, guiding values, and the context generating the stress [13]. Higher stress levels are linked to lower self-efficacy, while better coping mechanisms correlate with higher self-efficacy and increased student pro-social behaviour [10]. Managing difficult classroom behaviours, employing varied pedagogical techniques, promoting student engagement [14,15], and dealing with heavy workloads and intense scrutiny contribute to teacher attrition [16,17]. Additionally, teachers face heightened accountability within the school context [18]. Teachers cite workload, poor work–life balance, and the target-driven culture shaped by government initiatives as key reasons for leaving. While many enter the profession for altruistic reasons—such as wanting to make a difference—the reality of teaching, shaped by accountability and performativity pressures, leads to disappointment and early exit [19]. This reflects a disillusionment with the broader teaching context and the pressures of accountability. Thus, maintaining their well-being is crucial for teachers to fulfil their roles effectively [20].Teacher stress is also linked to attrition [21] and the motivation to leave the profession [22]. The overload of non-teaching activities, such as administrative tasks [16,23,24], contributes to stress, leading to mental ill health, burnout, and ultimately exit from the profession [25]. The literature reports that teaching daily poses numerous challenges, causing teachers to experience stressful events and negative emotions like anxiety or anger during class [26], most especially for primary school teachers, who have reported more stress in the literature than other types of teachers [27,28]. A recent literature review [29] clearly indicated that primary school teachers were the most stressed and may face more challenges in managing disruptive behaviour from young children, which can negatively impact their well-being [30,31]. They may require more energy and patience to handle younger children, which can be exhausting and require a high degree of emotional labour, and experience higher levels of workload and stress due to the constant need for attention and supervision of young children [32]. The perception of teaching as stressful may be influenced by coping responses and social support [33].Teachers need effective coping strategies to maintain their well-being and teaching quality [34,35]. Poor health and coping abilities in teachers are associated with significant stress levels, suggesting that greater coping skills and well-being can lead to more innovative, challenging, and effective teaching, thereby improving educational outcomes [36]. Teacher coping methods are increasingly recognised as key determinants of teacher effectiveness [5]. Coping, defined as the cognitive and behavioural efforts used to manage specific external or internal demands perceived as exceeding one’s resources [37], represents a valuable resource for individuals dealing with stressors, improving their levels of well-being [11]. Previous research has focused on how coping strategies can alleviate stress and promote a higher quality of work life [38,39]. Teachers employ coping strategies to change stressful situations or make them more manageable when they cannot be altered [12].International studies suggest that most causes of teacher stress are only weakly associated with coping strategies, thus raising concerns about teachers’ mental health and the effectiveness of their coping mechanisms [5]. Coping strategies are critical for physical and psychological well-being when facing challenges and stress [11]. Bermejo-Toro et al. [7], Kim et al. [40], and Nwoko et al. [29] all reported that coping strategies help to improve teacher well-being and sustain teachers when they experience inadequate support [41,42], preventing burnout [43].Teachers use a variety of coping strategies to maintain their well-being, often combining several approaches rather than relying on a single method [44]. Hamama et al. [45] suggested that both internal and external coping resources, along with self-control, increase teacher well-being. However, without effective coping strategies, teachers are more likely to experience burnout [46], highlighting the urgent need to reduce stress levels in the teaching profession [12]. Psychological constructs such as personality and self-efficacy significantly contribute to teachers’ coping strategies [47]. Selecting appropriate coping strategies can help future teachers view stressful situations as challenges rather than difficulties, facilitating adaptation to the profession’s demands [48]. Greater teacher coping skills and well-being lead to improved educational outcomes [36].Addressing teacher coping mechanisms is crucial for dealing with stress and burnout, which negatively affect teachers’ commitment to their profession [49]. Teacher commitment is vital to educational outcomes, attracts high public expectations, and increases the burden on teachers in an already stressful profession [46]. In response, teachers in stressful environments have developed resilience strategies to cope with stressors [50]. Few qualitative studies have explored the coping strategies adopted by primary school teachers to support their well-being, and even fewer have asked teachers to describe their coping strategies holistically even though it is vital [41]. Teacher well-being significantly impacts both the school environment and their families [1].Therefore, this study sought to answer the research question “What are the personal and school-based occupational well-being enabling initiatives that teachers utilise to cope with the demands of their job?” The aims of this study were two-fold: (1) to investigate the personal and school-based well-being-enabling initiatives that teachers use to maintain their occupational well-being, and (2) to develop a coping strategy model that enhances teachers’ occupational well-being. This study sought to provide insights into how teachers use their personal and school coping resources to ensure their well-being, expanding upon prior research and filling the key knowledge gap on maintaining teachers’ well-being. 2. Methods2.1. Research DesignThis study is part of a bigger project that investigated Australian primary school teachers’ occupational well-being that was guided by the OECD teacher well-being framework, which includes four core well-being dimensions (cognitive, subjective, physical/mental, and social) [16]. The present study adopted a phenomenological qualitative research design to explore the personal and school-based well-being-enabling initiatives that positively influence teacher occupational well-being. The approach focuses on understanding and interpreting teachers’ lived experiences within their natural contexts [51,52]. By employing this approach, this study aimed to explore teachers’ personal narratives and experiences, providing a rich, contextual understanding of how coping strategies influence teachers’ well-being [53] within the primary school educational setting. The phenomenological methodology allows for a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which teacher- and school-initiated coping strategies contribute to their well-being, and seeks to uncover the nuanced, deeply personal experiences of teachers. The focus on primary school teachers is justified by the unique challenges they face, including managing young students with diverse developmental needs, creating foundational learning experiences, and balancing heavy workloads with limited resources [23,24,25]. Primary school teachers often play a critical role in shaping children’s early educational experiences, making their well-being essential for effective teaching and long-term student success. Additionally, primary educators are particularly vulnerable to stress and burnout, which underscores the importance of identifying strategies that support their occupational well-being [27,28,29].2.2. Participant Recruitment and SamplingA combination of purposive and convenience sampling techniques was used to recruit participants for this study. Initially, participants were recruited using purposive sampling, targeted at registered Australian primary school teachers and school leaders across Australia. Recruitment was conducted through educational forums and social media platforms dedicated to educators. Subsequently, snowballing was utilised to increase participant numbers. All potential participants were provided with detailed information about the study’s aims and the voluntary nature of their participation.2.3. Data CollectionData were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews, allowing for the flexibility to probe deeper into participants’ responses and explore emergent themes. The interview guide was developed based on the research question (seeAppendix A) and reviewed by experts in educational psychology and qualitative research to ensure comprehensiveness and relevance. Interviews were conducted via phone call or video conferencing at various times based on the participants’ preferences and were recorded with their consent. Each interview lasted approximately 45–60 min, providing ample time to explore the participants’ experiences and perspectives thoroughly. Before the interview, participants were given a brief overview of the study’s purpose and the interview process, and their consent and demographic variables (context and years of teaching experience) were obtained. To ensure confidentiality, participants’ names were replaced with pseudonyms. The interviews continued until data saturation was achieved [54]. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and participants were offered the chance to review their transcripts to validate the accuracy and interpretation of their experiences.2.4. Data AnalysisThe transcribed data were coded and analysed in NVivo (QSR International/Lumivero Pty Ltd., Denver, CO, USA; Version 12 for windows) by three of the co-authors (JCN, EA and BSMA) to ensure the credibility of the results. The data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s six-phase framework [55], which is particularly suited to phenomenological studies. The analytical process involved familiarisation with the data, generating initial codes, searching, reviewing, defining and naming themes, and producing the final report. This approach allowed for the systematic organisation and interpretation of the data, ensuring that the findings were grounded in the participants’ experiences. Throughout the analysis, reflexivity was maintained, with researchers documenting their assumptions, biases, and reflections, to ensure the credibility and authenticity of the findings [56]. Peer debriefing and member checking were employed as additional credibility checks to enhance the trustworthiness of the study’s outcomes. Illustrative quotes were reported verbatim to support the study’s findings. Participants were entered into a draw to win one of four AUD 50 gift cards as part of reciprocity back to the participants for their involvement in the study [53].2.5. Ethical ApprovalThe James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee granted ethics approval (H8638) for this study. Participants were informed about the study’s purpose, the right to withdraw at any time without any consequence, and the measures taken to protect their privacy and personal data. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their participation in the study. All data were anonymised and securely stored to maintain confidentiality. 3. ResultsA total of 21 Australian primary school teachers comprising classroom teachers (n = 11), specialist teachers (n = 4), learning support teachers (n = 2), and school leaders (n = 4) participated in this study. Most of the teachers were female (95.2%) and worked in public schools (57.1%). The participants were from five Australian states—Australian Capital Territory (9.5%), New South Wales (23.8%), Northern Territory (19%), Queensland (23.8%), and Tasmania (23.8%). Teachers were aged between 29 and 62 years and had between 1 and 20 years of teaching experience. Class sizes ranged from 7 to 30. Most of the teachers had a Bachelor degree (57%). Ninety-five percent of the teachers had participated in in-service training (95%) and some of them (19%) taught composite classes—more than one grade level (e.g., Years 2/3).The results of this study show different coping strategies used by teachers to enhance their occupational well-being. These strategies were coded into ten themes and categorised under two headings, namely personal well-being-enabling initiatives (five themes) and school-based well-being-enabling initiatives (five themes) as presented below with illustrative quotes.3.1. Personal Well-Being Enabling InitiativesTheme 1—Setting boundaries:The teachers emphasised the importance of learning to set personal limits as a critical personal strategy for managing occupational well-being. They also highlighted the necessity of saying “no” to additional responsibilities when necessary to preserve personal time and mental health, and stressed the importance of prioritising one’s own well-being over external demands. For many teachers, this process developed over time through experience.“So, I think I’ve learned to set my boundaries. Now I’m older and better at saying, this is what I can do and take it or leave it sort of thing in a nice way. But I think leadership in every school I’ve worked at they’ve always tried to take more and push more for more. …So, I think it’s important to create boundaries and to say what you want to do and what you physically can’t do…”(Zelon)“I think for the most part I would say to myself, I can only do what I can do within the plan that I’ve got and I’m not going to be sitting here till 11 o’clock at night marking papers and doing whatever if I don’t get it done within a certain time, it just doesn’t get done. So, I just figured, if I don’t do this, or this or this, it’s not gonna matter so much… and that was just a survival thing because, I’ve got one friend who is a person who can’t leave those things…, and she had to take time away from teaching a couple of times…. She just wearied herself to the bone, and I’m not the type of person that will do that. I will just let you know that’s enough. And I’ll do what I think is important, regardless of what anyone else is telling me is important. I’ll just make up my own mind and decide if I can do that, or if I can’t, and if I can’t, I just leave it”(Lally)Similarly, teachers reported setting boundaries by restricting work-related activities, such as only responding to emails during school hours. This discipline helped them preserve personal time.“Coping is sometimes saying ‘no’ to certain things. You know, being able to stop, but also standing your ground also to certain things …, like emails from parents. And I’ll say right now I don’t respond to emails at all. So that parents know that I also have a life outside of school. …, I’m going to respond in the morning and all that. …, I really disciplined myself to respond like during school time. So that it doesn’t become a habit for parents to just think they can just email me any time. Really discipline myself to just stop, and enjoy something else.…”(Saks)Theme 2—Exercise and physical health:Teachers found that exercise and physical health practices, such as walking, running, or going to the gym and maintaining a healthy diet, were effective ways to unwind and recharge after demanding days in the classroom. These routines provide teachers with a sense of control over their mental well-being, enabling them to manage stress more effectively.“I exercise 3 to 4 times a week, and yeah. Eat well, try to just eat well and exercise, and going outside when I can. Take a walk. Enjoying nature and stuff that still helps me with my well-being. Going to the seaside. and that sort of stuff”(Mira)“Every five weeks I’m taking a mental health day, and I’m going away for the weekend. And that’s a big improvement than what I’ve done previously. I’m taking some time out in the holidays to go away and look at the ocean”(Ash)“Going for a walk, Pilates’, talking to colleagues, talking to friends…. I suppose smiling when you meet someone and genuinely interested. Finding something that is common ground. I suppose just going and talking to them”(Maz)Theme 3—Social support and interactions:Spending time with friends enhanced teachers’ occupational well-being, providing a reliable source of emotional relief and balance outside the school environment. Teachers underscored the importance of friendships in offering a space to unwind, share personal challenges, and maintain a healthy work–life balance.“So, getting out, camping and spending time with friends. Like everyone, kind of worked hard. But then they are really fun”(Sey)“I suppose getting a good network of friends. Make time for doing things in the evening. So, I catch up with friends in the evening sometimes. I do pilates with a friend once a week so I have to go with her, and I catch up with a friend regularly to walk her dog or dogs”(Maz)Social interactions with friends also allowed teachers to disconnect from their work and engage in restorative activities.“I make time in the evenings or weekends to do something with my friends. It helps me relax and enjoy time away from school.”(Mira)Theme 4—Mental Health and Mindfulness practices:Many teachers emphasised the importance of actively addressing their mental health needs and adopting mindfulness practices to navigate the pressures of their profession. Some teachers highlighted the value of seeking professional help to manage their mental health. Regularly consulting a mental health professional allowed them to develop healthier coping mechanisms and gain perspective on the challenges of teaching.“I’m getting better at not internalising it. Like I used to think, particularly in the time when I wasn’t coping and ended up going on workers comp. I thought I should be able to deal with it myself. And I was keeping it to myself, then. So, it was just becoming big. I see a psychologist now. But I’ve only seen her twice in the last 12 months, because I did have a period where I was seeing her regularly recently in the last two years”(Ash)In addition to professional support, mindfulness practices such as deep breathing and meditation were mentioned as practical tools for reducing stress.“I just take a deep breath, and I just pray to God. Am a Christian, I just pray to God to help me. That’s what I do to be honest. I go to the gym to exercise, so that helps me too mentally”(Zem)Theme 5—Work–life balance:Teachers maintained a balance between work and personal life by leaving work-related stress at school and by ensuring to relax.“It was that, when you leave school for the day, walk out the gate knowing that you did everything you could. You worked as hard as you could, and then you leave it there. You don’t take it home with you. So, if I have had a bad day, or the class I’m teaching is challenging, then I don’t take that home with me and think about it all night at home. I put it down there at work and then I tackle the next challenge the next day when I come. I think it’s important to have that work/life balance. let everything that has happened to remain in school so you don’t go home with them”(Raba)They highlighted the role of personal activities in maintaining work–life balance. By consciously separating their professional duties from their personal time, teachers were able to create space for rest and relaxation. Others chose to work part-time and shared that this flexibility was key to managing workload while maintaining a healthy balance.“I try to relax on the weekends. I’m doing gardening, and I have a pool which is really nice so I’m lucky. We go down to the beach and go swimming. So, you know, with my children, and I’ve got 2 at home, and 2 stepchildren as well, that are here at weekends. So, you know, we take them off to the beach, and things”(Esan)“Only because I work point 8. If I was full time, I wouldn’t have been able to do it. Point 8 is 4 days a week. One day off. Oh, on that one day I would do my school work. May be 4 or 6 h of school work. So, that I can spend my weekends more free with my family but also when it gets to Sunday evening I am also doing school work”(Maz)3.2. School-Based Well-Being Enabling InitiativesTheme 1—Supportive Leadership: Teachers reported supportive leadership as an important strategy to foster their occupational well-being, highlighting the critical role that school leaders play in creating an environment where they [teachers] feel valued, heard, and supported. They highlighted the importance of open communication with leadership. They also underscored the positive impact of having a leadership team that is aware of and responsive to teachers’ well-being needs.“I make sure I’m very open with my supervisors. So, if I’ve got things going on in my home world, I try and let them know what is going on. So, they will be more empathetic to my situation. If something was to happen or that kind of thing”(Raba)“I trust and I know that my assistant principal and my principal are very aware of my personal well-being needs. And I get the support that I need to deal with those”(Ash)Leadership that actively provides support was seen as crucial for teachers’ success. Teachers appreciated it especially when the principal valued and protected staff.“I think I felt more valued then, I felt more supported. I think the principal that I had then was the type of person that is always, if a parent complained about something, she’d pass it on to you if she didn’t think it was warranted. Whereas the principal that I have [now]…, they’re more likely to listen to what the parent had to say and make you more accountable to the parent, follow-up phone calls, those sorts of things all the time you know. That principal I had first had a psychology degree, was able to make staff feel valued and part of the school community, and she would protect you”(Lally)Theme 2—Support from colleagues:Teachers emphasised the importance of connecting with colleagues, sharing experiences, and building a sense of community within the school environment. The ability to rely on peers for emotional and practical support fostered a sense of community within the school, helping teachers manage the pressures of their work.“Talking with colleagues after school, you have a really hard day you go to the staff room and you debrief with your colleagues. They usually know what I’m talking about”(Sod)“I think it is also important to get into the staffroom and interact with other people. It kind of even limits any stress or kind of just brings you back into perspective. So that you don’t get stuck in your classroom doing everything you need to do. Sometimes it’s important to prioritise just being social, interacting with other people so that’s helpful. And then as well I got given some advice when I started my teaching career”(Raba)Having a supportive and collaborative workplace where colleagues mutually respect and support each order contributed significantly to a positive work environment. For newer teachers, the support from colleagues was invaluable.“I have respect for my colleagues, and I know that they have respect for me. They have a lot of respect for me and my role. We have bond together… which is important. You can be yourself. Yeah, everybody can be (themselves)…I would say that 90% of the staff feel like they can be themselves and not be judged”(Ash)“Talking to colleagues actually, and especially because I was, quite new to teaching, and I had a really good sort of bunch of colleagues around me, and I could talk to them about any problems at work, and they would support me”(Esan)Theme 3—Flexibility and autonomy:Teachers pointed out the importance of flexibility in managing additional tasks.“If genuinely teachers are expected to do things over and above the classroom role like paperwork, for example reports, personalised plans, stuff like that, they’re generally given time out of class to work on those”(Ash)Having autonomy in how and when work is conducted, especially in alternative (such as part-time and online distance education) teaching settings, empowered teachers to perform their duties more effectively while maintaining personal well-being. The teachers shared how autonomy over workload and external interests helped them manage stress.“Because I am a part time teacher. I can maintain my stress okay. I feel like it’s in hand because I have lot of interest outside of school with animals or community, volunteering, whatever, and I have flexibility in my role. I feel a balance, and I feel happy with that. So, I can maintain any of the stress build-up from school. I can let it go. I can release it. I’m feeling good about my well-being right now”(Nath)“I like distance [online] education because it allows for a lot more flexibility. I’m just happy with where we are at the moment.”(Penny)Theme 4—Resource availability:Teachers highlighted the importance of having the tools they need to effectively manage their classrooms and deliver quality instruction. They acknowledged the challenges that arise when resources are insufficient.“As far as the school providing me with the resources I need to work with the kids, I don’t think it’s a realistic expectation. Schools would probably need double the funding they have now to do that”(Ash)Despite these limitations, teachers often find ways to make the best use of the resources available, but the lack of adequate support can contribute to added pressure and stress.“If I make a resource, I keep it. I don’t throw it out. I laminate it and I keep it, so it’s always there. But you’re always creating new resources too. I’ve got a lot of stuff online that I’ve made over the years and then I can go back and reuse it or I can tweak it. I try to work smarter not harder”(Ash)Having enough resources impacts not only the effectiveness of teaching but also the overall classroom environment. When these resources are lacking, it becomes much harder for teachers to meet the expectations placed upon them.“It’s not necessarily about the training it could be the physical environment, and it could be about the support that teachers need in order to be able to cater for the different needs. We know what the needs are. We understand what they are. We got that training…. We’ve got all tht. We just don’t have the means to actually carry out a program that would support the situation”(Lally)Theme 5—Proactive approaches to address challenges:This involves anticipating potential issues—whether related to classroom management, student behaviour, or workload—and implementing strategies to manage them effectively. Teachers emphasised the importance of taking proactive steps to maintain control over their professional environment. The teachers provided examples of proactive strategies used with students to prevent disruptions.“We tried things like proactive breaks, where the student knows, they are going to have a break at a set time, he calls it the ‘Fun House’, so it’s where he goes and they set up the punching bag, different activities. So, we’re not waiting for a meltdown to happen, then [before] taking him out for break, No!”(Saks)They also emphasised the importance of individualising instruction based on student strengths as a proactive measure.“Getting to know the kids through the parents. Having meetings around what their strengths are…, manipulating the curriculum a little bit to be able to accommodate those strengths. Working around the things that might be preventing them from learning.… So really just individualised, tailored, targeted instruction”(Wet)3.3. The SHIELD Model to Enhance Teachers’ Occupational Well-BeingBased on the findings and identified themes from the qualitative exploration of Australian primary school teachers’ experiences in relation to their occupational well-being and coping strategies, a comprehensive teacher support model was developed as a major outcome of this study. This model, named SHIELD, combines both personal and school-based coping strategies to provide a holistic approach to teacher well-being and retention in the profession (Figure 1). By implementing these comprehensive strategies, a sustainable and supportive work environment can be created for teachers. Teachers can protect their well-being with the SHIELD model. The SHIELD model is a comprehensive framework designed to enhance teacher well-being and effectiveness by integrating personal and school-based coping strategies. The acronym SHIELD stands forSupport from Colleagues: The foundation of the SHIELD model is robust support from both colleagues and leadership. In a teaching environment, mutual support and collaboration among colleagues create a sense of community and shared responsibility. Teachers benefit from having colleagues who understand their challenges and provide emotional and practical support. This fosters an inclusive and supportive school culture. Ash emphasised, “The people I work with, they’re really good. They are supportive, everybody works together, it’s a collective responsibility for the children”.Healthy Lifestyle and Exercise: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is vital for managing stress and enhancing overall well-being. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient rest contribute to physical and mental health, enabling teachers to cope better with the demands of their profession. Encouraging teachers to prioritise their health can improve energy levels, reduced stress, and greater resilience. Mira shared, “I exercise 3 to 4 times a week, and eat well, try to just eat well and exercise, and going outside when I can”.Interactions and Social Connections: Social interactions and connections within and outside the school environment are essential for alleviating stress and maintaining a positive outlook. Engaging with colleagues and friends, participating in social activities, and building strong relationships can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging. These interactions help teachers to debrief, share experiences, and gain new perspectives on handling challenges. Raba noted, “It is important to get into the staffroom and interact with other people. It kind of even limits any stress or kind of just brings you back into perspective”.Empathy and Understanding in the Workplace: Empathy and understanding from both colleagues and leadership are critical components of the SHIELD model. When teachers feel understood and supported, they are more likely to express their concerns and seek help when needed. Empathy in the workplace fosters a culture of care and respect, which can significantly reduce feelings of isolation and stress. Sore mentioned, “They (leadership) have that bond, everybody does. They are pretty good in terms of support for our mental health”.Leadership that Listens: Effective leadership that listens and responds to teachers’ needs is fundamental for a supportive work environment. Leaders who are approachable, empathetic, and proactive in addressing teacher concerns can significantly enhance teacher morale and job satisfaction. Providing opportunities for professional development, recognising achievements, and involving teachers in decision-making processes are ways leaders can demonstrate their commitment to teacher well-being. Open communication channels between teachers and school leaders ensure that teachers feel heard, valued, and supported in their professional journey. Penny stated, “I’ve had really good support and understanding from them [leadership]. Goes both ways as well. Being honest and upfront”.Development of Personal and Professional Boundaries: Setting and maintaining personal and professional boundaries is crucial for preventing burnout and ensuring sustainable well-being. Teachers need to learn how to manage their workload effectively, prioritise tasks, and say no when necessary. Encouraging teachers to establish clear boundaries helps them balance their work and personal lives, reducing the risk of stress and exhaustion. Zelon said, “I think I’ve learned to set my boundaries. Now I’m older and better at saying, this is what I can do, and take it or leave it sort of thing in a nice way”.Figure 1.Open in a new tabThe SHIELD model.The SHIELD model provides a holistic approach to supporting teacher well-being by integrating key elements that address both personal and professional needs. By fostering a supportive environment, promoting healthy lifestyles, encouraging social connections, practicing empathy, providing responsive leadership, and helping teachers establish boundaries, the SHIELD model aims to create resilient, effective, and satisfied educators. Implementing this model can lead to improved teacher retention, enhanced teaching quality, and better educational outcomes for students. 4. DiscussionThis study was conducted to explore the occupational well-being-enabling coping strategies employed by Australian primary school teachers. Teaching is a demanding profession, both physically and mentally, requiring high emotional involvement, which can lead to significant anxiety and stress [57,58]. As teacher coping methods are increasingly recognised among the key factors determining teacher effectiveness [5], an understanding of these strategies with a view to improving them is essential. Effective coping strategies aim to help teachers maintain personal integrity and a sense of control over their challenges [59,60]. Coping strategies can influence how stress is experienced and may reduce its impact [61,62]. Given that teaching is inherently an emotional endeavour [63], coping is essential for sustaining teacher well-being and preventing burnout [43].In this study, teachers’ coping strategies were categorised into two broad areas, personal and school-based well-being initiatives, which were synthesised into the SHIELD model. The SHIELD model aligns closely with the OECD teacher occupational well-being framework, which focuses on cognitive, subjective, physical, mental, and social well-being. The SHIELD components, such as Support, Empathy, and Interaction, enhance social well-being by fostering collaboration and emotional support, while Healthy Lifestyle and Leadership that Listens promote physical, mental, and subjective well-being by encouraging stress management, resilience, and job satisfaction. By integrating personal and school-based coping strategies, SHIELD also addresses cognitive well-being, helping teachers manage workloads and set boundaries to prevent burnout. Together, these elements create a holistic approach to improving teacher well-being.The findings suggest that teachers exhibit distinct patterns of coping based on their individual strengths and skills [59]. Different strategies work for different teachers, depending on their personal circumstances and the support available to them. A significant finding from this study is the crucial role of support from both colleagues and leadership in managing stress. Teachers reported that their work environments were generally supportive, with school leadership providing the necessary resources and feedback to help them perform their roles effectively. Social support, including emotional support like sharing concerns with colleagues, was a key coping strategy, aligning with previous research [64,65,66,67]. Seeking advice from leadership also played a crucial role in teachers’ positive occupational well-being. Supportive leadership is essential as a stressful work environment can negatively impact teachers’ self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and emotional well-being [24,25,68,69]. The literature strongly supports the importance of principal support in enhancing teacher well-being [70,71,72].Social connections, including strong relationships with children, colleagues, and parents, were vital for coping. Good rapport with all stakeholders improved teachers’ occupational well-being and helped them manage the demands of their profession. Teachers emphasised the importance of professional relationships as a key coping strategy, as highlighted in previous studies [60,66]. Additionally, maintaining a balanced lifestyle, including ensuring time for lunch breaks and good sleep, was crucial for managing stress effectively. Teachers also noted that self-efficacy in managing classroom dynamics and parent relationships significantly enhanced their well-being, supporting findings from Kilgallon et al. [73] and Kennedy et al. [74].Empathy and understanding from leadership were essential in supporting teachers’ well-being. Teachers appreciated when leadership allowed them to reduce their workload or adjust their roles, such as switching to part-time work or changing from classroom teaching to support roles [75]. This flexibility helped teachers maintain their stress levels and occupational well-being, which aligns with research suggesting that manageable workloads protect against stress [71,72]. Empathetic leadership that provided time for teachers to complete their work, recognised their efforts, and created a supportive work environment was shown to enhance job satisfaction and well-being, echoing findings by Skinner et al. [76] and Walter and Fox [32].Effective leadership that listens and responds to teachers’ needs is critical for maintaining teacher well-being. Teachers who felt supported by their leadership were more likely to seek help, ask questions, and suggest improvements, such as establishing proactive breaks for students with special needs. This proactive approach helps manage classroom dynamics and supports teacher well-being, particularly in diverse and challenging classroom settings [24]. Additionally, teachers who felt appreciated and valued by their leadership were better able to manage stress and maintain a positive outlook, further emphasising the importance of strong, supportive leadership in schools [77].Teachers used a variety of personal coping strategies to manage stress, including exercise, healthy eating, nature walks, and engaging in religious practices such as prayers. Exercise was particularly highlighted as an effective way to support occupational well-being, corroborating previous findings [64]. Faith and prayer also served as significant coping mechanisms, with teachers turning to religion during stressful times, consistent with the literature [5]. Setting and maintaining personal and professional boundaries was another critical coping strategy. Teachers reported that experience had taught them to set clear limits on their workload and to prioritise tasks, leaving less critical work for another time. This ability to say “no” to non-essential tasks and manage time effectively was crucial in preventing burnout and maintaining a healthy work–life balance, consistent with findings by Lindqvist et al. [60].4.1. Implications for PracticeThe findings from this study have significant practical implications for enhancing teacher well-being and retention. Teachers employ a variety of coping strategies to manage the stress inherent in their profession, and the support they receive from school leadership plays a critical role in their overall occupational well-being. Leadership support is paramount in reducing the impact of stress on teachers. Principals and school leaders should be intentional about providing robust support systems and professional development opportunities. Recent studies have reported that the most effective well-being measures are those integrated into supportive whole-school cultures that reduce burdensome workloads while enhancing feelings of autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Generally, teachers prefer school policies and practices that promote manageable workloads over one-off or short-term well-being activities [78].Additionally, the study revealed that establishing boundaries is a key coping strategy for teachers. This suggests that schools should incorporate boundary-setting into professional development programs, offering teachers the support they need to maintain a healthy work–life balance [60]. Furthermore, teachers reported seeking professional help as part of their coping strategies, indicating a potential need for schools to establish counselling centres specifically for teachers, in addition to those available for students. In-service training should also focus on expanding teachers’ coping repertoires to help prevent stress and burnout in their current roles [79].4.2. Strengths and Limitations of This StudyThis study’s qualitative approach allowed for an in-depth exploration of teachers’ personal experiences and coping strategies, providing rich, detailed insights into the specific ways teachers manage stress and maintain well-being. The development of the SHIELD model is another notable strength, providing a structured, practical framework that can be directly applied in educational settings to enhance teacher well-being and retention. However, this study was limited to a specific group of Australian primary school teachers, which may not be representative of all teachers. The findings may not be transferable to teachers in different educational contexts or geographical regions. Additionally, the self-reported data may have introduced social desirability bias, as participants may have presented themselves in a more favourable light or may not have accurately recalled their coping strategies and experiences. 5. ConclusionsThis study identified key personal and school-based initiatives that teachers use to cope with job demands. Personal strategies include setting boundaries, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, seeking social support, and practicing mindfulness. School-based initiatives, such as supportive leadership, collaboration, flexibility, and professional development, enhance well-being. Together, these approaches help teachers manage stress, prevent burnout, and maintain a healthy work–life balance. The SHIELD model integrates these strategies into a practical framework, offering a comprehensive approach to fostering teacher resilience and well-being.The SHIELD model emphasises the need for robust support systems, healthy lifestyle promotion, social connection, empathetic leadership, and clear personal and professional boundaries. By implementing these strategies, schools can create a sustainable and supportive environment that not only enhances teacher well-being but also improves retention rates and educational outcomes. Future research could adopt a longitudinal approach to track changes in teacher coping strategies and well-being over time. This would provide insights into how these strategies evolve with experience and changing professional demands. Additionally, the long-term effectiveness of the SHIELD model and its applicability across different educational contexts could be explored."

        "Title": "The Role of Curiosity in Virtual Environments: A Conceptual Integration",
        "Abstract": "AbstractBrands need to have a digital strategy. Yet, it is difficult to grab consumers’ attention in virtual environments. We present the Curiosity in Virtual Environment (CVE) model, which integrates empirical and conceptual work on virtual environments, goal content, and curiosity. The model seeks to serve as a guiding framework and tool for research scholars and practitioners working in virtual environments who want to communicate with consumers. To elaborate and present the CVE, we first discuss the main characteristics of virtual environments and types of goal contents, followed by a brief introduction to the theoretical developments of curiosity. The model is then introduced, showing four quadrants in which practitioners should have an easier (more difficult) time grabbing consumers’ attention. We then conduct a selective review of experimental studies on curiosity and consumption, identifying three voids in the field. We finish the article by suggesting directions for future research and acknowledging the limitations of the CVE model.Keywords:curiosity, virtual environments, appetites, social goals, consumption goals",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionIt is a marketing truism that brands should have digital strategies to communicate effectively with consumers and enhance their experience. Yet, the problem is that consumers do not naturally engage with brands’ efforts, as seen in the low clickthrough rates of most digital advertising and brand content on the Internet and social media [1]. In addition, virtual environments are saturated with brand information. This complex situation has been noted by business scholars, suggesting that the biggest challenge is to grab consumers’ attention [2]. Consequently, brands use different strategies to increase engagement with their brands and their advertising efforts in virtual environments. We posit that, explicitly or implicitly, brands try to elicit consumers’ interest and curiosity concerning their content. Brands want consumers to have interest and curiosity in their offerings, advertised promotions, and general knowledge. Hence, interest and curiosity are central targets of brands’ efforts. Brands want to grab consumers’ attention and then increase brand engagement. In addition, consumers hold different goal contents in their minds, which direct their attention. As the Internet has continued to grow and improve its development [3], understanding what motivates consumers and triggers their curiosity in virtual environments is crucial. In light of this, we propose a conceptual model that posits that three components need to be included to understand behavior in virtual environments: (1) the main characteristics of virtual environments, (2) the types of goal content held by consumers, and (3) the nature of the epistemic emotion of curiosity. All three components are needed to understand consumer behavior and help brands develop effective digital strategies that are capable of grabbing consumers’ attention. To reach the goal of elaborating our Curiosity in Virtual Environment (CVE) model, we briefly discuss the main characteristics of virtual environments, the importance of goal content in relation to consumer behavior, and the conceptual developments of curiosity. We finish the article by conducting a selective literature review of the strategies used to elicit curiosity in consumers and some directions for future research and limitations of our model.Component 1: The main characteristics of virtual environmentsVirtual environments have six important characteristics: (A) their social nature, (B) their high penetration and frequency of use, (C) their attractiveness for brands, (D) their most popular activities, (E) datafication, and (F) information overload. We organize this section around these six characteristics.Their social natureFrom its early development, the Internet provided an environment for consumers to achieve different goals [4]. By far, social goals were more important, and they continue to be more important. Consumers could join interest groups, chat with friends and strangers, find lovers, and talk about their favorite movies and soap operas, among other social activities. The Internet quickly became a virtual social world, which represented an extension of consumers’ “real” social world.Empirical studies and conceptual developments have shown the importance of social goals. One study examining reviews of Amazon suggested that even though consumers were engaging in economic behavior by evaluating the quality of books, it was clear that social goals in the form of community integration, bonding, establishing credibility, and seeking to stand out were prominent [5]. Another study showed that the top 500 videos viewed on YouTube only included three brands [6]. Hence, consumers show interest and curiosity about the content broadcast on YouTube, but their specific curiosity is not aimed at learning more about brands and their offers. The importance of social goals is further supported by research conducted on social platforms, such as Facebook, indicating that about 70% of consumers’ online activities involve checking the “timeline” and information about friends and others perceived as interesting [7]. Hence, searching for and looking at social information are consumers’ main activities on social media, entertainment platforms, and the Internet in general, with important implications for brands.B.Their high penetration and frequency of useThe Internet, the use of smartphones, and social media apps have shown steady growth. The most recent data indicate that around 5.30 billion consumers have access to the Internet and around 5 billion use social media apps [3]. In addition, more than 5.61 billion consumers have a mobile phone [3]. In terms of the frequency of use, 96% of consumers use their smartphone within the first hour of being awake and spend several hours daily on it [3]. A recent survey found that searching for information and connecting with others are the two most important reasons to go online [3]. Interestingly, the same survey found that “killing time” is also a popular reason for going online [3]. Given the penetration of the Internet, social media apps, and smartphones, and how consumers interact with these devices, it is safe to conclude that virtual environments are popular places for consumers. Consequently, it is not surprising that brands find virtual environments attractive to reach and develop a relationship with consumers. Virtual environments are where brands need to be. Yet, it is important to point out that the high penetration and use also contribute to information overload (as discussed later on). It is not surprising then that grabbing the attention of consumers is becoming more challenging.C.Their attractiveness to brandsBrands want to communicate with consumers. Hence, brands want to be where consumers are. Virtual environments represent great opportunities to reach consumers and establish relationships. Recent data show that spending on digital advertising has more than doubled in the past five years, and advertising spending on search engines and social media has the top two spots [3]. Yet, as several business scholars suggest, the main obstacle for brands is that consumers engage more with social information than brand content. In addition, there are thousands of brand messages trying to grab consumers’ limited attentional resources [8]. This has resulted in low levels of consumer engagement. Evidence shows that most digital advertising achieves low clickthrough rates [1]. Hence, virtual environments are attractive yet competitive. Brands need to take this into account when generating their digital strategies. In a way, brand content also contributes to the information overload in virtual environments. One important characteristic of the virtual environment relates to the most popular activities.D.Their most popular activitiesThe virtual environment is too broad to cover all aspects. Consequently, we focus on social platforms or social media apps, online communities and blogs, and search engines, the three most popular online activities [1]. We posit that consumers show different goals and behaviors when engaging with social platforms, online communities, and search engines. Hence, the differences between these three should be considered.1.1. Social PlatformsSocial platforms are the main source of social life, especially for younger consumers [8]. When on social platforms, the main goal of consumers is to search for and obtain social information. Consumption information and information about brands are relatively less important. When on social platforms, consumers usually show high levels of interest and curiosity, which fuel their motivation to connect with others, consume and create content, and choose the type of content they want to pay attention to [9]. Given these characteristics, it is a challenging environment in which to attract consumers’ attention to brand content. Yet, brands need and want to have a presence on social platforms because this is where consumers spend a significant amount of their online time [3].1.2. Online Communities and BlogsOnline communities and blogs could have social or brand-related information. Online communities could be organized around a social theme, a consumption theme, or a combination. Blogs could also be organized around social or consumption themes. One study suggests that the most popular blogs are related to consumption, where consumers discuss different topics from technology and fashion to celebrities and movies [10]. Consumers are likely to show naturally high levels of interest and curiosity in brand-related information, which could represent an opportunity for brands. Yet, we expect important individual differences as well. Specifically, online communities and blogs usually have two types of participants: active content generators and lurkers [11]. Active content generators and lurkers are likely to have important differences in their levels of interest and curiosity [11].1.3. Search EnginesCompared to social platforms, online communities, and blogs, we could claim that the use of search engines is primarily energized by actively “looking for something” [1]. This “looking for something” is probably more related to consumption than social goals [1], which represents an opportunity for brands and their offerings. Yet, brands also face fierce competition because millions of brands have access to search engines and compete for the attention of consumers. Indeed, digital scholars posit that consumers often only pay attention to the first results provided by search algorithms, practically ignoring the rest of the search results shown [8].Organic results are already a consequence of how interesting the content of a given website is. Interesting content often satisfies consumers’ interest and curiosity. Search engine algorithms, to some extent, consider how interesting a website is in the form of relevance and authority [1], two metrics used to determine the results after keyword searches. Paid or sponsored results come from auction bids [1]. Yet, brands still need to provide consumers with relevant information to satisfy their curiosity; otherwise, brands would be wasting their money by generating only minimal clickthrough rates.E.DataficationThe last two characteristics, datafication and information overload, create a paradox. Brands have greatly benefited from datafication but, at the same time, the main challenge is the same: grabbing consumers’ attention. Both are discussed next.Virtual environments are full of consumers’ information. Datafication is defined as converting into data online behaviors that were not measured, quantified, assessed, or understood previously [12]. The quantified behaviors in current virtual environments are likes, shares, sentiments, positive or negative comments, search volumes, and reputation indices, among others [13]. According to virtual communication scholars, datafication is a powerful tool used by brands to improve the precision of targeted advertising. We see at least two implications of datafication. First, datafication has greatly helped brands improve their advertising efforts. Yet, even if targeted advertising has improved its precision, brands still face the challenge of grabbing consumers’ attention because there are many brands competing for consumers’ attention, creating a paradox. Datafication is and will continue to be important. Yet, the challenge of grabbing consumers’ attention is and will persist in being relevant and one of the main obstacles faced by brands.Second, datafication could provide rough, imperfect, yet relevant behavioral indicators of what is interesting to consumers to grab their attention. For example, one could argue that if consumers constantly click on, like, and share advertising messages, consumers might be interested in consumption-related information. They might be in a consumption mode, which represents valuable information for brands. Conversely, if consumers click on, like, and share messages coming from friends and interesting individuals, they might be more interested in social information. They might be in a social mode, which represents valuable information as well. In addition, if consumers’ amount of liking, sharing, and clicking in terms of social or consumption-related information is high, beyond a predetermined level, one could argue that their interest is higher than consumers showing a lower amount of liking, sharing, and clicking. Having these indicators will help brands know what consumers are currently interested in; yet, the challenge for brands remains almost the same: to grab consumers’ attention. The reason is simple: many brands will be interested in showing advertising to consumers, especially consumers in a consumption mode and showing high levels of interest as indicated by the information coming from the process of datafication. The main challenge of grabbing consumers’ attention is still relevant, which leads us to the last characteristic of virtual environments.F.Information overloadThe last defining characteristic of virtual environments is the amount of information, or information overload, available to consumers, including social and consumption-related information, which makes the challenge of grabbing consumers’ attention truly difficult [2,14]. Putting it simply, there is more information to attend to than available attentional resources [15]. Thus, the most valuable scarce resource is not money but consumers’ attention, with at least two important implications for brands [4]. First, it is harder to grab consumers’ attention due to information overload [2]. Thus, brands will need to spend more money to secure some type of attention, preferably quality attention. Indeed, the cost of grabbing the attention of consumers has grown significantly in the last decade, leading business scholars to coin the term “The Economy of Attention” to describe this challenge [2]. While the challenge of grabbing consumers’ attention is not only limited to the virtual environment, it is certainly a characteristic that needs to be considered when trying to generate interest in consumers. Second, the acknowledged challenge of grabbing consumers’ attention opens up the possibility of focusing on the content, or type of content, most likely to succeed. Content could be informative or entertaining [2], and efforts could be tailored depending on what consumers are looking for and their degree of attention. Thus, one way to grab consumers’ attention is by providing content that generates interest in consumers, with important implications for virtual environments and our conceptual model.After discussing the six main characteristics of virtual environments and their implications, we are in a better position to discuss the concept of goals. The type of goal content is the second component of the Curiosity in Virtual Environments model.Component 2: Consumer’s goals in virtual environmentsGoals play an essential role in understanding consumer behavior in virtual environments [16] because goals energize and direct consumers’ motivation. The implications of this second component can be captured by two-subcomponents: (A) the influence of goals and (B) the type of goal content.The influence of goalsGoals are conceptualized as knowledge structures that influence important psychological processes such as attention, memory, information processing, attitudes, and judgments, among others [17]. These knowledge structures become activated, influencing what consumers pay attention to and remember, and their attitudes toward receiving new information. Given how competitive and saturated virtual environments are, knowing how goals influence attention, memory, and attitudes is important.B.Goal contentGoal content also plays an important role in human motivation [18], reflecting what individuals want to do and achieve and the type of information they search for. Consumers can either have a social or consumption goal in mind. A social goal implies the desire to interact with others in virtual environments, to seek and obtain social information. A consumption goal implies the desire to interact with brands, or their content, to seek and obtain brand and consumption-related information. For the development of our conceptual model, we posit that goal content plays an important role in understanding why it is sometimes easier (more difficult) to grab consumers’ attention.The main characteristics of the virtual environments and the goal content that consumers might seek are not enough to explain when and why brands should be able to attract consumers’ attention. We need to include a third component, examining the nature of curiosity, which is discussed next.Component 3: The nature of curiosityThe third component involves three subcomponents: (A) the history and role of curiosity, (B) types of curiosity and their connections with appetites, and (C) implications for brands.The history and role of curiosityThe examination of curiosity has a long tradition dating back at least 70 years to the work of Berlyne [19], who proposed the distinction between perceptual and epistemic curiosity. Perceptual curiosity is related to sights, sounds, and images that draw interest. Epistemic curiosity involves being interested in learning new information. Brands could potentially elicit both types of curiosity.Most experts on human development posit that individuals are born with the drive to explore their environment [20]. Hence, humans are curious by nature. Searching for and learning new knowledge is inherently pleasant. Curiosity is an epistemic emotion elicited by engaging in epistemic activities [21]. Epistemic activities include searching, inquiring, and learning new information [22]. Consumers in virtual environments usually search for social or consumption information. Thus, understanding the role of curiosity in virtual environments holds great potential.B.Types of curiosity and their connections with appetitesRecent conceptual developments concerning curiosity include the distinction between interest-type curiosity and deprivation-type curiosity [23]. Interest-type curiosity is driven by the emotion of interest and is often connected with liking information (liking appetite system). Interest-type curiosity is energized by the anticipation of pleasure coming from searching and learning new information. Given that individuals are interested in learning new information, the urgency is not as intense as in the case of the second type of curiosity, the deprivation-type. The search for interesting information could be related to products and services, or consumption information, yet is more likely to be connected with social information, information about friends, relatives, and people of interest, just for the simple reason that in virtual environments, consumers tend to be more interested in social than in consumption information. This is an important point for understanding and explaining why consumers often do not want to engage with brand efforts and why consumers react negatively to interruptions by brands.The second type of curiosity, deprivation-type curiosity, is driven by uncertainty and is often connected with wanting and needing information (wanting appetite system) [23]. Deprivation-type curiosity is energized by the need to search and learn needed information. It is conceptualized as a deficit, an uncomfortable realization of needing information. Hence, it is driven by negative emotions, as opposed to interest-type curiosity. In addition, as in interest-type curiosity, consumers could need information related to products and services or social information, information about friends and important others.The distinction between interest- and deprivation-type curiosity, along with their respective appetite tendencies, liking, and wanting [23], could help us understand how consumers behave in digital environments and what type of brand efforts are likely to be ignored or attended to (see the work of [11] for some on the initial propositions of curiosity in digital environments). Similarly, this distinction could help us understand when the timing of brand efforts could be seen as useful or annoying, depending on whether consumers are driven by wanting and needing information or by liking new information and depending on whether consumers are searching for consumption or social information. This understanding could be useful, given that most brand efforts involve interrupting consumers [1].C.Implications and challenges for brandsGenerating curiosity is something that brands can utilize to their advantage in virtual environments. Yet, most experts on attention posit that we have limited resources [24], and salience stimuli are more likely to attract some of these limited resources [24]. Humans simply cannot pay attention to every brand effort nor can they be curious about each brand encountered on social platforms or the Internet. Consequently, brands have to battle for the attention of consumers, to battle for the interest and curiosity of consumers. This is why the conceptual developments of curiosity are relevant to understanding brands’ efforts in digital environments.Connecting the main characteristics of virtual environments, component one, the types of goal content that consumers endorse, component two, and the types of curiosity with the respective appetite tendencies, component three, allows us to propose a conceptual model. In the next section, we present this conceptual model. We then selectively review the empirical literature and its implications for our model. 2. The Curiosity in Virtual Environments (CVE) ModelOur conceptual model includes the distinction between interest-type and deprivation-type curiosity, the distinction between the goal of obtaining social versus consumption- or brand-related information, types of appetites, liking versus wanting, and the assumption that curiosity varies along at least two levels, high or low, to simplify things and make the model workable. These multiple combinations, leading to four quadrants, allow us to propose different scenarios in which brands should have a more difficult or relatively easier time attracting the attention of consumers (seeFigure 1).Figure 1.Open in a new tabConceptual model.High deprivation-type and interest-type curiosity for new information (high wanting and high liking)In this first quadrant, consumers show high deprivation-type and high interest-type curiosity for new information, which are energized by high wanting and high liking. In this scenario, consumers perceive both a deficit in their information and a genuine interest in searching and obtaining new information. The search for information is driven by positive emotions such as interest and pleasure, or interest-type curiosity, and by negative emotions such as uncertainty and doubt, or deprivation-type curiosity. If consumers’ main goal is to obtain social information, they might not be receptive to brand efforts. Consumers’ high wanting and liking for social information does not put consumers in the mode of being receptive to consumption information. For brands to succeed in gaining the attention of consumers, they would have to present something highly original and useful to change consumers’ focus of attention. Specifically, brand efforts should be highly entertaining [2], useful (the deprivation part), or original and fun (the interest part) to attract consumers’ attention. Obtaining consumers’ attention is not the only obstacle that brands face. Consumers might react negatively to brand efforts if their goal is to obtain social information and brands interrupt or truncate consumers’ social goals (they want and like new social information). One empirical study suggested that when driven by high deprivation-type curiosity, consumers exhibit a thoughtful, careful approach to learning new information. In contrast, when driven by high interest-type curiosity, consumers exhibit a fun, carefree approach to learning new information [25]. Given that consumers show both high wanting and liking, these tendencies to process information differently might cancel each other out, being up to the originality and usefulness of brand efforts to elicit a careful or carefree approach to learning, assuming that brand efforts are able to attract consumers’ attention.If the goal of consumers is to search for and obtain brand- or consumption-related information, consumers should be receptive to brand efforts. Brand efforts could be informative or entertaining [2]. Receptiveness should be even higher if brand efforts match the content of consumers’ goals. For example, if consumers search for information on women’s shoes on Instagram, consumers would be receptive to brand efforts showing discounts or information on a new, attractive brand of shoes. The challenge for brands is still to grab consumers’ attention because there are hundreds of brands providing information to consumers. Hence, the goal of attracting at least a minimum amount of attention from consumers, through clicking on an interesting ad, seems more reasonable than when consumers search for social information. Brands still need to compete for consumers’ limited attentional resources.2.High deprivation-type and low interest-type curiosity (high wanting and low liking)In this second quadrant, consumers show high deprivation-type and low interest-type curiosity, energized by high wanting and low liking appetites. In this scenario, consumers are mainly driven by the need for new information and negative affect in the form of uncertainty, doubt, or frustration. The perceived deficit and gap in knowledge is uncomfortable and consumers need to close this gap by searching for and obtaining information [26]. If the goal is to obtain social information, consumers would not be willing to switch their attention to brand efforts. Even highly original and useful brand information is likely to be ignored because the need for social information overcomes brand efforts. In addition, consumers might react negatively to brand efforts because consumers’ goals are social and driven by negative emotions. This is especially true if brands only follow an outbound strategy [1] in which consumers are constantly interrupted when seeking to obtain social information. This is probably the most challenging scenario for brands and it is more likely to be found on social platforms such as TikTok or Instagram. The low clickthrough rates of brand efforts observed on social media might be explained by high deprivation- and low interest-type curiosity when consumers want to search and obtain social information [7].Conversely, if consumers need brand- or consumption-related information, consumers should be receptive to brand or consumption information to close their information gap. Yet, given that the wanting of information is high, consumers should pay closer attention to information that matches the content of their consumption goal (e.g., I am looking for Italian restaurants and TikTok is showing a relevant video of a new restaurant specializing in Italian-type pizza and pasta). Brand efforts should be informative [2] to help consumers close their knowledge gap. Consumers’ deprivation-type curiosity should lead consumers to aim at obtaining original and useful brand information. Conversely, if brand or consumption efforts do not match consumers’ goals, consumers might pay attention because they are in a “consumption mode” or if brand efforts are truly original and useful. Conversely, brand efforts might be ignored if consumers are not only driven by a high deprivation-type curiosity but also by time urgency (limited time available). The high deprivation-type curiosity, along with the wanting of information, opens up a new opportunity for brands in the form of inbound marketing strategies. Inbound marketing strategies generate useful content about brands and consumption [1], and consumers should not only be receptive to useful brand content but also spontaneously and voluntarily seek this type of information. Consumers should be appreciative of brand and consumption-related information, which helps alleviate their information gap.3.Low deprivation-type and high interest-type curiosity (low wanting and high liking)The third combination is one in which consumers show low deprivation-type and high interest-type curiosity energized by low wanting and high liking appetites for information. In this scenario, consumers are primarily driven by the interest, pleasure, and joy coming from searching for and learning new information. Consumers are likely to exhibit a carefree type of information processing. If consumers have a social goal in mind, their focus is on social and entertainment information. They might not be bothered by brand efforts, but they might not be highly receptive either, because the goal is social and their affect is positive. Brands need to make extremely appealing efforts to grab consumers’ attention. Brand content should be mainly entertaining [2]. Brands might also follow a social strategy in which brands help consumers obtain social information and play the role of the facilitator, with the potential of obtaining some indirect benefits [7].If consumers have the goal of obtaining brand- or consumption-related information, consumers are in a receptive mode. Brand efforts should be informative [2]. They are more likely to be attracted to brand or consumption information consistent with consumers’ search content (I am looking for shoes, brand efforts about shoes are more relevant than efforts about jeans). Consumers would also be receptive to brand efforts not connected with their search content as long as they are perceived as original, useful, or informative to grab their attention. Both digital strategies, outbound and inbound, are likely to work because consumers have a high interest-type curiosity for new information.4.Low deprivation-type and low interest-type curiosity (low wanting and low liking)When consumers have low deprivation-type and low interest-type curiosity energized by low wanting and low liking appetites for information, consumers might be online out of boredom and seeking to just “kill” time. In this scenario, consumers are not driven by the need to close an information gap or by their interest in specific information. If consumers have a social goal in mind to cope with their boredom, they should not be receptive to brand efforts unless the efforts help consumers cope with their boredom. Brand content should be entertaining [2] to help consumers “kill some time”. If the goal is related to consumption, consumers might be receptive to brand efforts, but primarily if the efforts entertain consumers. However, their buying intentions might not be strong because their motivational drive is weak (low wanting and low liking). Research on virtual environments [3] suggests that “killing time” or “dealing with boredom” are common reasons to go online. Hence, marketers should consider the scenario of low deprivation- and interest-type curiosity for new information to attract consumers’ attention.Our model seeks to integrate the conceptual developments on appetites and curiosity with consumers’ information goals, brand and consumption efforts, and the nature of virtual environments. We now review a selection of studies that have empirically tested the relationship between brand efforts and curiosity and how these findings map onto the model just described. The review is selective as opposed to exhaustive. 3. Empirical StudiesThe purpose of reviewing the empirical literature was to examine how brand scholars have examined curiosity and its implications for virtual environments. Thus, we reviewed articles in which brand efforts had the goal of increasing consumers’ curiosity. These efforts usually focused on increasing engagement or buying intentions, among others, by eliciting curiosity. Given our interest in reviewing articles that wanted to increase consumers’ curiosity, we focused on only experimental studies, placing special emphasis on the mechanism through which curiosity was enhanced. We used the Web of Science search engine to find articles with the following keywords and their respective combinations: curiosity, marketing, consumer behavior, buying intentions, purchase intentions, and consumption. We limited our search to articles published since 2000 (when virtual environments started flourishing) and to experimental studies where researchers used different manipulations to increase curiosity. When reviewing the articles, we discussed how they fit our conceptual model.3.1. Empirical FindingsIn one of the pioneering studies assessing curiosity in advertising [27], researchers examined the influence of information gaps in advertising on curiosity. Participants were randomly assigned to three levels of knowledge gap: high, medium, and low. The results showed that participants exposed to advertising with a medium knowledge gap had higher curiosity than participants in the other two conditions. This enhanced curiosity led to more visits to the brands’ websites and to greater time spent on the websites. Participants were asked to simulate that they had a consumption goal in mind. It is unclear whether individuals with a social goal would react similarly to advertising with different levels of knowledge gap because advertisements would need first to grab consumers’ attention.This second study is similar to the study just described but was conducted in the context of sports advertising [28]. The study was also based on the information gap conceptualization of situational curiosity. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: high, medium, and low knowledge gap. The results showed that participants in the medium-level information gap condition showed greater curiosity than participants in the other two conditions. This enhanced curiosity led to greater intentions to watch the sport being advertised. Participants simulated having a consumption goal related to sports. It is unclear whether participants with a social goal would respond similarly to the three levels of knowledge manipulated in the advertising.In one of the best-designed studies, researchers examined how moderate levels of mystery could increase curiosity, leading to greater purchase motivation and purchase intentions [29]. The argument was that moderate mystery should lead to greater curiosity than high or low mystery, based on the information gap conceptualization of deprivation-type curiosity. Moderate mystery was operationalized as providing consumers with some information but also withholding some information. The results robustly showed that moderate mystery led to higher curiosity, which then had a positive relationship with purchase motivation and intentions. Curiosity was treated as a mediator, explaining the process by which moderate mystery increased purchase motivation and intention. The study was conducted in a virtual environment in which participants simulated having a consumption goal. It is unclear whether this strategy would be effective if consumers had a social goal in mind. Yet, these findings showed that brands could “manipulate” the amount of information given to consumers to increase curiosity, with important implications for virtual environments.This study examined how rumors and preannouncements can increase curiosity concerning new products [30]. Rumors usually come before preannouncements of new products. The basic premise was that rumors might instigate uncertainty, which might make consumers feel curious about the new product talked about in the rumor. In two experiments, the results showed that radical products led to greater curiosity, but only when the rumor about the product was ambiguous. By using radical versus incremental innovation in products, the researchers also included a degree of novelty in their experimental design. Curiosity then had a positive relationship with purchase intention. We could argue that participants had a consumption goal in mind, so we do not know how the rumor of a new product would grab the attention of consumers when they have a social goal in mind. Yet, we could conclude that if participants already have a consumption goal, rumors that are ambiguous, with an information gap, are able to generate greater curiosity for radical products, that is, products that truly show something novel.When on social platforms, consumers are usually interested in engaging with information posted by friends and significant others. One study [31] tested the influence of group membership, with information coming from groups of friends or not, on buying intentions by increasing consumers’ curiosity. Consumers were shown an advertisement created by a brand on social media shared by friends or not. The results showed that posts on social media coming from groups of friends had a positive indirect influence on buying intentions by increasing curiosity. We could argue then that participants were simulated to be in a consumption mode, with a consumption goal on a social media app. It is not clear then if consumers with a social goal in mind would pay attention to the advertising even when it is shared by groups of friends. Yet, we posit that consumers want to socialize with their friends and brands focused on facilitating social interaction could benefit from these relationships in the form of virtual word of mouth and recommendations, among others [7].After consumers decide to visit a website, we still observe a great deal of variability in the amount of engagement observed. In one study [32], researchers tested the role of virtual rooms in consumers’ engagement with websites. Curiosity was conceptualized as a mediator explaining how virtual rooms increase consumers’ engagement and buying intentions. In two experiments, the results showed that virtual rooms led to positive consequences in terms of buying intentions and exploration behavior. These positive outcomes were explained by increases in curiosity. For this particular study, participants were already engaged with a website for clothes and the researchers manipulated whether the website had a virtual room or not. Hence, consumers had a consumption goal activated and the virtual room enhanced the whole experience by increasing consumers’ curiosity.This article is about incident curiosity [33]. The basic premise was that incidental curiosity would lead consumers to prefer unhealthy food. The article uses the deprivation type of curiosity approach to suggest that this aversive state of deprivation might lead consumers to engage in approach behavior, leading to choosing more rewarding food, which is unhealthy food. In three experiments manipulating incidental curiosity, the results showed that participants in the high curiosity condition reported higher levels of situational curiosity, which led to them choosing more unhealthy types of food. For this study, consumers had a consumption goal in mind by showing ads for cellphones to induce curiosity. It is unclear how this ad to induce curiosity would work if participants had a social goal in mind.One study conducted in the domain of advertising tested whether an ad using augmented reality could lead to greater curiosity and attention, which would then lead to more positive brand attitudes [34]. Across one field experiment and two laboratory experiments, the results showed that participants exposed to the ad with augmented reality showed greater curiosity, paid greater attention to the ad, and developed more positive attitudes toward the ad than participants exposed to a regular ad (the control condition). For this study and its three experiments, participants already had a consumption goal in mind. Under the influence of this goal, consumers had more curiosity when exposed to the ad with augment reality, which translated to greater attention and more positive attitude toward the ad.This specific study examined and tested different triggers of curiosity, information gap, ambiguity, and novelty on situational curiosity [35]. The researchers created ads with information gaps, ambiguities, novelties, and a control condition. Overall, across four experiments, the results showed that the information gap and ambiguity conditions generated greater curiosity than the other two conditions. Higher curiosity led to more positive brand evaluations due to increases in positive emotions and enhanced expectations. In these four experiments, participants were put in a consumption mode, so we could argue that they had a consumption goal. It is uncertain whether participants would notice the triggers used in advertising if they were browsing the Internet or social media with a social goal in mind.In one study, curiosity was treated as a mediator to examine how congruency, that is, more or less congruent new products, influenced brand engagement by increasing curiosity [36]. Product congruency was conceptualized as the degree of congruency of a new product with previous products from the same brand. Participants were Twitter (now X) users. Participants were exposed to a Twitter message showing either a congruent or less congruent product for the brand Heinz. The results showed that less congruent products led to greater brand engagement by increasing consumers’ curiosity. The experimental protocol did not address whether consumers had a social or brand-related goal in mind. It did not address either whether participants were driven by deprivation or interest-type curiosity; yet, we could argue that a deficit in product knowledge caused by the less congruent product generated greater curiosity. The present study has implications for social media apps because, as mentioned earlier, it is difficult to attract consumers’ attention.In another study [37], participants were asked to simulate that they were browsing on Instagram, searching for a dress (the participants were women). The study assumed that participants had a knowledge gap, deprivation-type curiosity, for novel products shown on Instagram and whether this knowledge gap led to higher curiosity and intentions was conditioned by the perceived socio-economic status of the women shown wearing the dresses. The results of two experiments showed that novelty had a positive direct influence on product curiosity and then intention, but only for moderate socio-economic status women shown wearing the dresses, as opposed to high socio-economic status women. In this study, participants were on social media with a consumption goal in mind. In this scenario, participants had more curiosity for novel products shown by women with a moderate socio-economic status.The article is about framing a product, an idea, or something as reflecting change [38]. This framing could lead participants to feel curious about the product. Announcing change could trigger curiosity. The authors conducted seven experiments, a combination of field and laboratory experiments. In the first experiment, they manipulated whether the advertising included the word change and measured the clickthrough rates as a behavioral proxy of curiosity. The advertisement was launched on Facebook, increasing the external validity of the study. The clickthrough rates were low in general but significantly higher in the change condition as compared to the control condition. In the remaining laboratory experiments, the framing of change was compared to a control condition, and curiosity and interest in new information and buying intentions were assessed. The results showed that the framing of change led to greater curiosity, higher interest in new information, and higher buying intentions than the control condition. Consumers were likely to simulate having a consumption goal in mind.The article focused on unconventional messages in packaging as a way to grab consumers’ attention [39]. The basic premise was that unconventional packaging messages activate an automatic thinking process, eliciting curiosity. They focused on impulse buying, conducting several experiments. In experiment two, participants were randomly assigned to an unconventional versus conventional message condition. The results in the unconventional condition showed that participants had higher levels of purchase intention, explained by increases in situational curiosity. The results of experiment three replicated the effect of unconventional messages on curiosity, but this effect was only significant when an emoji was present. The presence or absence of an emoji was a moderator. In this study, participants were asked to simulate that they were in a consumption mode with a consumption goal in mind. It is unclear whether the unconventional messages would be able to grab consumers’ attention and elicit curiosity when consumers have a social goal in mind.The article argues that waiting for a product or a service can lead to higher curiosity with positive implications [40]. Curiosity was treated as a mediator. The premise was that a wait signals to consumers that something interesting is going on or something attractive is happening, enhancing their curiosity to find out. In experiment two, participants were randomly assigned to wait or not. Participants in the wait condition had higher buying intentions and those intentions were explained by higher curiosity. Experiment three also had two conditions, wait and not wait, and it was conducted in the context of museums. The results showed that participants in the wait condition had higher levels of willingness to visit the museum and this positive effect was explained by higher curiosity. In this well-conducted study, participants were in a consumption mode with a consumption goal in mind.In an interesting study [41], participants were randomly assigned to a promotion versus prevention focus condition and exposed to vague or specific new product preannouncement (NPP), and the researchers assessed the effect of this interaction on curiosity and word of mouth. Participants were asked to imagine that they were browsing the Internet and encountered two types of new product announcements, vague versus specific, for a brand of smartphones. The results showed a positive influence of a vague NPP on curiosity and word-of-mouth intentions, but only for individuals who were induced to have a promotion-focused mindset. This study capitalized on the fact that vague preannouncements left out important details about the new product, generating an information gap that participants were curious to close. It is not entirely clear whether participants had a social or a consumption goal in mind because they were just asked to imagine that they were browsing the Internet. Yet, it is likely that this situation, just browsing the Internet, is a common situation that consumers face.In another study worth noting for the combination of laboratory and field experiments [42], researchers tested the use of curiosity nudges to induce participants to choose should options versus want options in different domains. The conceptual development was based on the main characteristic of deprivation-type of curiosity, an information gap, and how satisfying this gap could only be achieved by choosing should options as opposed to want options. Across two laboratory experiments and two field experiments, the results showed a robust effect of curiosity nudges on the decision to choose should options rather than want options. This study was not conducted in a virtual environment, yet it does have implications. Marketers could use the findings of this study to design curiosity nudges and try to induce consumers to behave in a certain way. Marketers could capture consumers’ attention first by using curiosity nudges and then achieve the desired outcome.In another study [43], participants were exposed to more creative or less creative packages, as previously validated in pilot studies, of music albums, and researchers examined the effect on curiosity, processing motivation, and then purchase intention. The results showed that participants exposed to more creative packaging showed higher levels of curiosity and then higher processing motivation, which translated to higher purchase motivation. While the experiment was not conducted in a virtual environment, it does have implications for virtual environments. Creative packaging could lead consumers to feel more curious and process information with higher motivation than less creative packaging. The exposure to more creative packaging could occur in virtual environments in which consumers could have either a consumption or a social goal.After conducting searches, consumers have many links to engage with websites that might seem relevant. The degree of engagement with the chosen website can be enhanced by using virtual reality (VR). One empirical study [44] tested, in two experiments, the role of VR. The results showed that virtual reality immersive environments led to higher consumers having perceptual curiosity than non-immersive environments. This enhanced curiosity was positively related to greater consumer creativity. Both experiments were laboratory experiments in which participants were already in the act of shopping. We could argue that participants had a consumption goal in mind and either an interest-type or a deprivation-type of curiosity, given that it was not specified whether individuals needed to buy something or they were browsing shopping sites.This article is on curiosity and advertising [45]. The main argument was that advertising that helps consumers close their information gap can make consumers less skeptical about the advertised products and the intentions of advertisers. The researchers manipulated exposing participants or not to advertising with information gaps and then assessed their curiosity and product evaluations. The results showed that advertising with information gaps led to greater curiosity than advertising with no information gap. When the brand helped alleviate this curiosity, participants felt less skeptical and evaluated the product more positively. The induced curiosity was specific to the product or incidental, and both had positive implications. Consumers were induced to have a consumption goal in some conditions and no goal in other conditions, extending the implications of these findings (seeTable 1for a summary of the experiments reviewed).Table 1.Summary of experiments reviewed.ArticleType of GoalConceptualizationMain FindingMenon & Soman [27]Assumed to have aconsumption goalKnowledge gapWorks best to have moderate knowlege gap toelicit curiosityPark et al.

Main ResultsAfter reviewing 19 experiments in which the goal was to increase curiosity, we can draw the following conclusions. (1) Most studies were successful at increasing curiosity. Practitioners can achieve the goal of increasing consumers’ curiosity in virtual environments, and our review showed what types of experimental manipulations were likely to succeed. (2) In almost all the studies, researchers had participants simulate that they had a consumption goal in which the stimuli shown were already assumed to be relevant to consumers. These studies did not have stimuli competing for consumers’ attention. This is an important omission because virtual environments are characterized by information overload [2,14]. (3) The manipulation of whether participants had a high or low level of either deprivation- or epistemic-type curiosity was absent. In other words, not a single experiment manipulated the urgency or the need for the consumption type of information. (4) Most studies, after assessing curiosity, focused on purchase intentions or brand evaluations, without considering additional behavior outcomes related to actual consumer behavior. The lack of emphasis on examining how consumers with a social goal in mind will respond to different stimuli designed to increase curiosity, the lack of manipulating how urgent or needed the information is for consumers, and limited emphasis on behavioral outcomes represent important research limitations and opportunities for the future. 4. Future DirectionsCombining our conceptual model with the empirical findings just reviewed, we see three directions for future research: conducting experiments in which social goals are included, manipulating how urgent or needed the information is for consumers, and examining additional outcomes beyond intentions and brand evaluations.A.Experiments with social goalsAs mentioned before, in almost all the experiments, participants were asked to simulate that they had a consumption goal, that they wanted to buy or try on a piece of clothing. Future studies could ask participants to simulate that they have a social goal in mind. Researchers could ask participants to simulate that they have a social goal of seeking information on what their friends did this past weekend and expose participants to advertising with knowledge gaps or ambiguous information and examine whether an information gap or ambiguous information is enough to attract consumers’ attention. Based on conceptual developments and empirical studies, we predict low levels of engagement when consumers have a social goal in mind. Yet, it is still relevant to understand if these low levels of engagement differ as a function of the types of advertising shown, information gap versus complete information. These types of experiments will also have the advantage of creating more realistic scenarios, with greater ecological validity.B.Manipulating urgency or how needed the information isConsumers spend several hours daily in virtual environments. Future studies could manipulate how urgent or needed information is for consumers and then expose participants to different stimuli trying to elicit curiosity. Based on our conceptual model, we predict that when consumers have a high deprivation type of curiosity, that is, truly needing social information, it will be difficult to elicit curiosity with consumption information. If consumers have a high deprivation type of curiosity for consumption information, it will be easier to generate curiosity and more likely to generate curiosity when the information searched by consumers matches the information shown. Conducting these types of experiments will generate relevant information for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the role of curiosity in virtual environments.C.Assessing additional outcomes beyond intentions.Thus far, the empirical literature has focused almost entirely on intentions and brand evaluations or other self-report outcomes. The literature has been useful in assessing how induced curiosity usually has positive relationships with buying intentions and brand evaluations, among others. Yet, beyond these self-report outcomes, we know almost nothing about the actual buying behavior of consumers. Researchers could assess other relevant outcomes, such as time searching for information, browsing the web, and time spent on the websites of the advertised brands, among others. These additional outcomes could be conceptualized as epistemic activities seeking to “know more” about the advertised brand, driven primarily by curiosity. These additional outcomes could provide researchers and practitioners with relevant information to examine curiosity and its implications for consumer behavior. 5. ConclusionsNowadays, the biggest challenge for brands is to grab consumers’ attention in virtual environments due to six relevant characteristics: (A) their social nature, (B) their high penetration and frequency of use, (C) their attractiveness for brands, (D) their most popular activities, (E) datafication, and (F) information overload. We also proposed that consumers have two main goals: social and consumption-related. The core of our model is the proposition that curiosity, an epistemic emotion, plays an important role in virtual environments. We developed a model that included the latest developments concerning types of curiosity, virtual environments, and types of goals that consumers strive for. After reviewing the empirical literature, we provided some directions for future research. We posit that the exploration, examination, and conceptualization of the role of curiosity in virtual environments hold great potential for business scholars, practitioners, and researchers. We hope our colleagues share our excitement about the role of curiosity in virtual environments."

        "Title": "Social Media Use and Academic Performance in Chinese Children and Adolescents: A Moderated Chain Mediation Model",
        "Abstract": "AbstractBased on data from the 2022 Chinese Minors’ Digital Life and Online Protection Survey, this study investigated the status quo of social media use and its influencing mechanism on academic performance among Chinese children and adolescents. The statistical results indicate that the average level of Chinese students’ social media use was generally low, with their academic performance varying across socio-demographic and schooling characteristics. After controlling for other variables, it was found that the frequency of social media use could exert a significant positive impact on students’ academic performance. Moreover, the mechanism analysis revealed that online learning behavior and prosocial behavior served as chain mediators linking social media use to academic performance. Specifically, students could transfer their social media behavioral patterns to the internet-based learning context, and then effectively utilize remote learning resources. Meanwhile, engagement with social media would cultivate individuals’ prosocial personality, thereby stimulating intrinsic motivation for learning and ultimately enhancing academic performance. The heterogeneity analysis further confirmed that the impact of social media use on students’ academic performance was stronger in lower-class families, underscoring the moderating role of family socioeconomic status in the relationship between social media use and academic performance. The findings suggest that if academic performance is regarded as an integral part of individual capacity development, then the rational utilization of social media resources might be a pivotal approach to alleviate the predicament of developmental inequality faced by students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.Keywords:social media use, academic performance, online learning behavior, prosocial behavior, family socioeconomic status",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionStudents’ academic performance is a net outcome primarily determined by personal cognitive and non-cognitive attributes, as well as the sociocultural environment in which the socialization process occurs [1,2]. Extensive empirical research has underscored the significance and multifaceted impacts of academic performance among school-aged children and adolescents. Specifically, some scholars pointed out that a strong academic performance not only alleviated the psychological stress caused by failure or underperformance [3] but also bolstered individuals’ self-assurance and mitigated issues, such as academic procrastination and psychological disorders [4]. Conversely, inadequate academic performance could lead to a heightened level of academic pressure experienced by adolescents, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns, suboptimal dietary habits, and a range of negative physiological responses [5,6]. Moreover, from a macroscopic perspective, academic performance also appears to be intricately intertwined with the sustainable development of the labor market. First, it could serve as a metric for evaluating problem-solving skills, which were significant predictors of the participants’ quality in the youth labor market. In fact, it was found that students with higher academic performance were more likely to receive better employment opportunities and higher salaries in subsequent career trajectories [7]. Additionally, as a crucial criterion for competitive selection within the education system, academic performance, played a pivotal role in the distribution and allocation of talents among different types of schools, which could exert an unignorable influence on the labor market structure [8]. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the current state and influential factors of academic performance in order to promote students’ comprehensive development.Among the various factors associated with academic performance, internet-related behavior is considered one of the most influential determinants in the digital era. In fact, reinforced by the widespread adoption of internet technology and rapid digitization, significant transformations have taken place in both the demographic composition of Chinese internet users and their patterns of online behavior over the past decade. According to China’s 53rd Statistical Report on Internet Development, 18.5% of China’s 1.092 billion internet users fell within the age range of 6 to 19 years old, with more than 95% of this group engaging in social media for instant communication and online entertainment activities [9]. Given the pervasive nature and popularity of social media among Chinese younger audiences, it is crucial for both public discourse and academia to pay close attention to its potential impacts on students’ academic development [10]. Admittedly, the accessibility of social media indeed fostered educational equity by providing children and adolescents with unrestricted access to a diverse range of free learning resources, which held particular significance for rural youth in China [11]. Furthermore, the convenience offered by social media platforms also empowered users to generate and publish digital content online, resulting in an abundant repository of user-generated resources. Through the personalized and collaborative learning platforms, Chinese students could actively participate in knowledge exchange and effectively utilize high-quality educational materials, thereby facilitating the resolution of learning challenges while enhancing academic performance [12].In addition, it is worth noting that the potential influence of social media use on academic performance does not manifest immediately and often requires specific mediating mechanisms to exert more substantial effects. To be specific, some researchers found that there were certain correlations linking online learning behavior and prosocial behavior with students’ educational development [13,14]. However, few studies have systematically analyzed the mediating roles of online learning behavior and prosocial behavior in the relationship between social media use and academic performance, particularly in non-Western contexts, such as Chinese society. As a result, it is necessary to incorporate these two behavioral factors into the analytical framework to further elucidate micro-behavioral mechanisms underlying how social media affects Chinese students’ academic performance. Moreover, previous research has mainly focused on specific age groups (e.g., junior school students), neglecting a comprehensive analysis of social media use among minors aged 6 to 18. In fact, there might be age-related heterogeneity in students’ cognitive and behavioral development from childhood to late adolescence [15]. In this study, we intend to address the above-mentioned oversights through using the data from a nationwide survey on Chinese minors’ digital life and online protection. In particular, we quantitatively investigate the mediating roles of online learning behavior and prosocial behavior, as well as the moderating role of family socioeconomic status between social media use and academic performance. From the perspective of Bourdieu’s sociological theory, the field of study practice is not reducible to the issue of individual learning attitudes or decisions, whilst any “choice” of study behaviors ought to be affected by both individual agency and social structural factors (e.g., online media environment) [16]. In this sense, our endeavor to investigate the mechanisms linking social media use and academic performance would yield significant policy implications for the advancement of children and adolescents within the context of online and offline interactive learning environments. 2. Literature Review and Research Hypotheses2.1. Social Media Use and Academic PerformanceSocial media generally serves as a network tool that facilitates individuals to share opinions, experiences, and perspectives in the digitalized society. It primarily encompasses social networking sites, microblogs, forums, and other forms of online communication. In comparison to traditional media channels, such as newspapers and television, social media exhibits remarkable advantages in terms of immediacy and interactivity. Hence, social media per se not only expands people’s access to information resources but also significantly reduces the opportunity cost associated with information transmission. Additionally, it has given rise to “virtual communication”, which enhances the potential for collaborative actions through social networks [17]. Meanwhile, children and adolescents, often referred to as “digital natives”, typically show an inherent inclination toward various forms of social media. For example, it has been found that more than 90% of American teenagers employ mobile devices for internet access while sending and receiving an average of more than 60 social messages per day [18]. As such, social media holds the potential to play a pivotal role in the educational development of children and adolescents within the digital social environment.Empirical studies conducted across different countries have indicated an inconclusive relationship between social media use and academic performance. To be specific, the majority of the existing literature supports the positive impact of social media on enhancing academic performance, particularly through its provision of networked and mobile learning opportunities for teenagers [19]. With the convenience offered by mobile intelligent devices, students are able to engage in ubiquitous and active learning, which could create favorable conditions for their educational development [20]. Additionally, the highly participatory and interactive nature of social media also empowers students to devise personalized learning trajectories, which would be beneficial for enhancing academic performance [21]. Additionally, the judicious utilization of social media ought to enhance students’ self-efficacy in the learning process, which would help to promote a passion for learning and improve study efficiency [11,22,23]. Nevertheless, some scholars have still highlighted that excessive use of social media might encroach upon study time, thereby impeding students from adhering to their original learning schedules and exacerbating academic burdens [24,25,26,27,28]. Evers’s analysis further revealed that sleep disorders arising from the use of social media could disrupt daytime learning efficiency and contribute to burnout, which established a cyclic relationship among social media, burnout, and low academic performance [29].Theoretically speaking, the inconsistent findings mentioned above may partly stem from variations in the sociocultural milieu that individuals inhabit. In Western societies, parents tend to adopt a more open and inclusive stance toward their children’s internet usage and study behaviors. This parenting style could potentially amplify children’s exposure to inappropriate online content through social media platforms and hinder their academic performance. In contrast to Western societies, the act of fostering children’s pursuit of education has long been esteemed as a prestigious familial endeavor in traditional Chinese culture. At present, the uncertainty surrounding economic development and the scarcity of high-quality resources have intensified Chinese parents’ awareness of educational competition. In the meantime, the existing educational institutions still adhere to a comprehensive ability-based selection mechanism, leading to evident stratification within the fundamental education system. Consequently, parents from diverse social backgrounds inevitably face the predicament of ensuring their children’s access to education [30]. In order to ensure exceptional performance in the high school and college entrance examinations, Chinese parents could endeavor to optimize social media as a valuable resource for promoting students’ academic achievements. Furthermore, the Chinese government has recently advocated for “Online Clear Action”, designed to foster a healthy online environment for children and adolescents. Thus, under the influence of Chinese family and social structure, social media use is more likely to play a positive role in students’ academic development. Therefore, considering the localized sociocultural context, the following hypothesis is proposed:H1:Social media use has a positive impact on academic performance in Chinese children and adolescents.2.2. The Mediating Role of Online Learning BehaviorOnline learning behavior refers to the learning activities conducted by learners using internet media platforms, highlighting their behavioral features of self-directedness and intrinsic motivation. In accordance with the life course theory, the primary aim of individual socialization is to facilitate minors’ secure development through intergenerational support while nurturing their autonomous personality traits during childhood and adolescence [31]. In this regard, online autonomous learning aligns with the objective of fostering autonomy through socialization. Nowadays, as digital technology becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, socialization is no longer confined to face-to-face interactions but gradually from offline to online scenarios. Thus, the tension between the dual objectives of “secure growth” and “independence” becomes increasingly salient [32]. Notably, children and adolescents can now easily construct interdependent relationships with their peers through mobile phones or other internet access devices. This situation may augment parental challenges in directly supervising their offspring. In fact, due to the inherent openness and anonymity of the internet itself, parents and teachers commonly possess limited knowledge regarding this young group’s online communication activities, so the lack of supervision undoubtedly engenders safety concerns throughout their online behavioral process [33]. Prior studies have demonstrated that the utilization of social media could enhance individuals’ digital literacy, strengthen their awareness and capacity to acquire online knowledge, and foster an exploratory learning habitus [11,12]. Moreover, social media use could also enhance individuals’ perception of academic self-efficacy, thereby fostering a more favorable psychological inclination toward learning [34]. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis:H2a:Social media use has a positive impact on online learning behavior in Chinese children and adolescents.Additionally, online learning behavior can also serve as a predictor of academic performance. For instance, Spitzer and Musslick carried out an empirical study harnessing a dataset of over 2500 K-12 students in Germany and revealed a positive correlation between online learning behavior and students’ academic achievement [13]. This association was partially attributed to the fact that online learning behavior facilitated access to abundant educational resources by promoting personalized learning approaches [21], which would be conducive to fostering broader connections with unfamiliar peer groups for knowledge exchange [35,36]. Based on the above analyses, we posit that social media use may indirectly influence academic performance through the mediating pathway of online learning behavior. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are put forward:H2b:Online learning behavior has a positive impact on academic performance in Chinese children and adolescents.H2c:Online learning behavior plays a mediating role in the relationship between social media use and academic performance in Chinese children and adolescents.2.3. The Mediating Role of Prosocial BehaviorProsocial behavior encompasses the range of actions exhibited by individuals during social interactions, including acts of assistance, cooperation, and sharing. This specific form of behavior generally conforms to social norms and demonstrates an individual’s conscientiousness, comprehension, and active involvement in public affairs [37]. In the digital age, an individual’s social media usage should closely pertain to real-life behavioral patterns [38,39]. For example, Boulianne conducted a meta-analysis and presented that the utilization of social media platforms had a substantial positive impact upon social engagement behaviors [40]. There are three possible explanations for this phenomenon. Firstly, from a psychological perspective, social media platforms actually offer an interactive online environment that can elicit moral identification and motivation among young users, which is beneficial for the development of offline prosocial behavior [41,42]. Secondly, social media can also serve as a crucial source of diverse social information that contributes to fostering “weak ties” among its users [43]. This characteristic effectively mitigates the proliferation of redundant information while simultaneously facilitating increased access to valuable insights into societal welfare initiatives (e.g., volunteer services). Thirdly, from a social network perspective, social media may enhance the users’ reservoir of social capital and expand their network of social relationships, thereby increasing the likelihood of accepting peer invitations to participate in specific prosocial activities [44]. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:H3a:Social media use has a positive impact on prosocial behavior in Chinese children and adolescents.Meanwhile, there is compelling evidence of a robust association between prosocial behavior and academic achievement [45]. Specifically, prior research has indicated that engaging in prosocial behavior could significantly enhance individual emotional and social cognitive abilities as well as psychological well-being [46,47]. In this case, students might better manage the stress associated with the learning process by bolstering their self-confidence and psychological resilience [14]. Furthermore, engaging in prosocial behavior also fosters a heightened sense of social connectedness [48]. This, in turn, could enhance students’ access to peer support and enable them to maintain a positive emotional state when faced with academic challenges. As such, it is likely that they would ultimately achieve improved academic performance [49]. Based on the aforementioned analysis and in conjunction with the inference of hypothesis H3a, it could be posited that the impact of social media use on academic performance may be mediated through prosocial behavior as an intermediary variable, thereby leading to the following hypotheses:H3b:Prosocial behavior has a positive impact on academic performance in Chinese children and adolescents.H3c:Prosocial behavior plays a mediating role in the relationship between social media use and academic performance in Chinese children and adolescents.2.4. The Moderating Role of Family Socioeconomic StatusChildhood and adolescence are critical periods for the formation of personality, with socialization within the family environment having a long-term impact on individual development [50]. Given that parenting behavior is widely acknowledged as the primary means of implementing family socialization, disparities in family socioeconomic status may further contribute to variations in parenting practice. Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of capitals, Lareau categorized parenting practice into two ideal types, i.e., “concerted cultivation” and “accomplishment of natural growth” [51]. More precisely, higher-class families tended to favor concerted cultivation, which emphasized achieving parental goals through active intergenerational communication and employing strict disciplinary measures in the process of child-rearing. On the contrary, lower-class families were more inclined toward the mode of natural growth, perceiving their children’s development as an organic progression and adopting a more lenient stance toward their children’s usage of social media. Considering the potential heterogeneity of parenting practice across different social classes, it is plausible that family socioeconomic status may exert an influence on the association between social media use and academic performance. Specifically, compared to families from a lower social class, those belonging to a higher social class tend to demonstrate significantly greater expectations and investments in their children’s education. As a result, parents with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to restrict their children’s non-study activities and allocate a substantial portion of their after-school time toward supplementary educational programs (e.g., shadow education). In other words, parents from higher social classes tend to assign more extracurricular tasks to their children, thereby limiting their engagement with social media activities. Therefore, in higher-class families, the elevated educational expectations of parents may, to some extent, weaken the effect of social media use on offsprings’ academic performance. Accordingly, we further propose the following hypothesis:H4:Family socioeconomic status moderates the relationship between social media use and academic performance in Chinese children and adolescents.It should be emphasized that online learning behavior and prosocial behavior are also interconnected and show a certain degree of positive association. Specifically, individuals’ online learning behavior can influence their knowledge accumulation and cognitive structure, direct their attention toward specific events or groups, and then enhance active participation in real-life prosocial behavior aimed at giving back to society [52]. Additionally, online learning platforms often encourage interpersonal communication and collaboration among users, which may cultivate an environment conducive to empathy development and promote their awareness of prosocial attitudes [53]. In a nutshell, based on the theoretical analyses, we constructed a moderated chain mediation model (seeFigure 1).Figure 1.Open in a new tabTheoretical model for this study. 3. Materials and Methods3.1. Data SourceThis study was based on the 2022 Chinese Minors’ Digital Life and Online Protection Survey, which was jointly organized by the Youth Rights Division of Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and the Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. An online questionnaire survey was conducted from May to July 2022 across 31 provinces in China, including autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The survey was designed to gather information regarding the digital literacy, psychosocial characteristics, and family education conditions of Chinese minors. Specifically, it employed a multi-stage stratified sampling method to investigate students aged between 6 and 18 years old, along with their parents. In the first stage, 3 to 4 prefecture-level cities were selected from each province. Then, four schools were chosen from each selected prefecture-level city, comprising two primary schools, one secondary school, and one high school/technical school. Within these selected schools, a random sampling approach was utilized to select one class per grade for conducting the questionnaire survey among the students in the selected class and their parents. After excluding respondents with missing data for key variables, a total of 8321 paired samples consisting of students and parents were ultimately retained for subsequent empirical analyses.3.2. MeasurementThe dependent variable of the current study was academic performance. We employed the following three items in the questionnaire to assess students’ academic performance: (1) What is your level of academic performance in class? (2) Are your parents satisfied with your academic performance? (3) Are you satisfied with your own academic performance? Among these, the first item gauged students’ objective academic achievement, while the latter two items measured it from both the parental and personal subjective perspectives. The possible responses to the three questions ranged from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating better academic performance. Principal component analysis was employed to extract a common factor from these three indicators, resulting in a cumulative variance contribution rate of 69.922%. Subsequently, for the sake of analytical convenience, we transformed the common factor into a continuous variable (ranging from 0 to 100) by means of the min–max standardization method.Social media use served as the core explanatory variable in this study, encompassing a wide range of activities conducted through social media platforms. These activities included interactive communication, information sharing, leisure and entertainment, content consumption and production, and other behaviors exhibited by individuals or groups. Regarding the operationalization of social media use, the survey inquired about the frequency characteristics of the following relevant activities: visiting Sina microblogs, engaging with online communities (e.g., Baidu, Tieba, Zhihu), utilizing social networking sites, obtaining news and information online, expressing opinions on social events through digital platforms, discussing societal issues with others online, and supporting fan-based activities (e.g., voting for idols online). The items were rated on a five-point response scale ranging from “never = 1” to “always = 5”, yielding a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.860. We calculated the mean score across these seven items to assess the frequency of students’ usage of social media.Regarding the operationalization of online learning behavior, the survey asked about the frequency at which the respondents engaged in the following activities: participation in online classes, completion of online homework assignments, utilization of online platforms for asking questions and seeking answers, retrieval of relevant online materials, memorization of English vocabulary through online means, engagement with online educational software, and acquisition of extracurricular knowledge through online sources. The respondents were asked to rate their responses on a five-point Likert scale ranging from “never = 1” to “always = 5”. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient value of 0.884 was obtained through an analysis of internal consistency reliability. Then, we computed the mean score across these seven items to measure students’ online learning behavior.Regarding the operationalization of prosocial behavior, we employed the following four items in the questionnaire for assessing students’ prosocial behavior over the past year: (1) monetary donations toward aiding individuals in distress; (2) active participation in volunteer service; (3) engagement in activities encompassing eco-friendly travel, water conservation, waste segregation, and reduction in plastic bag usage; and (4) assisting unfamiliar individuals. The response options for these items ranged from “never = 1” to “always = 7”, yielding a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.827. The scores of the four items were averaged to measure an individual’s level of prosocial behavior, with higher values indicating greater levels of prosociality.In the statistical analyses, we incorporated the following control variables: the student’s gender (male = 1, female = 0); household registration (urban registration = 1, rural registration = 0); school attribute (key school = 1, non-key school = 0); stage of schooling (as proxy variables for age). Additionally, to control for the influence of family background, we further introduced the following two variables, i.e., parenting style and family socioeconomic status. Regarding parenting style, the questionnaire included a set of questions that assessed parents’ strictness in seven dimensions, including study arrangements, scholastic achievements, daily schedule, social interactions, attire choices, online engagement duration, and television consumption habits. The response options ranged from “no management = 1” to “very strict management = 5”. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for these items was calculated as 0.893. We averaged them to obtain the value of the presenting parenting style, with a higher value indicating a more stringent parenting approach. Regarding family socioeconomic status, we operationalized this variable by considering the educational levels of both fathers and mothers, as well as the annual income of the family. Principal component analysis was employed to extract a common factor from these three indicators, with a cumulative variance contribution rate of 65.206%. Then, we recoded the family socioeconomic status into a continuous variable (ranging from 0–100) using the min–max transformation method. The descriptive statistical results of the research variables are presented inTable 1.Table 1.Descriptive statistics for the research variables.VariablesCodingMean (Percentage)Standard DeviationAcademic performance0 to 10051.25320.817Social media use1 to 51.6460.698Online learning behavior1 to 52.6850.844Prosocial behavior1 to 72.9921.290GenderMale = 1, female = 046.8%-Household registrationUrban registration = 1, rural registration = 048.8%-School attributeKey school = 1, non-key school = 037.7%-Stage of schoolingPrimary educationYes = 1, no = 041.0%-Secondary educationYes = 1, no = 024.0%-High school/technical school educationYes = 1, no = 035.0%-Parenting style1 to 53.5610.733Family socioeconomic status0 to 10031.24126.165Open in a new tab3.3. Analytical StrategyWe employed SPSS26.0 and the PROCESS3.5 plug-in for statistical analysis, which was conducted in three steps. Firstly, descriptive methods were utilized to outline the fundamental distribution characteristics of Chinese students’ social media use and academic performance across different groups in the digital era. Secondly, based on a stepwise regression method and bootstrap mediation effect testing, we quantitatively analyzed the path relationships among social media use, online learning behavior, prosocial behavior, and academic performance in order to validate the aforementioned research hypotheses. Lastly, by incorporating the interaction term into the statistical model, we further examined the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status on the relationship between social media use and academic performance. 4. Research Results4.1. Descriptive Statistics of Social Media Use and Academic Performance in Chinese Children and AdolescentsCurrently, the overall level of social media use among Chinese children and adolescents remains relatively low, with an average frequency score of 1.646 (seeTable 1).Table 2presents, in detail, the distribution characteristics of social media use activities, revealing that over 70% of the surveyed students have never engaged in specific online activities, such as fan support (81.6%), discussing social issues online (71.8%), and expressing opinions on societal matters through online platforms (70.7%). In contrast to social media use, the mean score of online learning behavior was significantly higher at 2.685 (seeTable 1), which suggests that Chinese parents tend to discourage non-educational internet usage due to concerns about diminishing their academic aspirations. Actually, parental close monitoring may, to a certain extent, impede students’ access to social media platforms and hinder the progress of digital education among children and adolescents.Table 2.The frequency distribution characteristics of students’ social media use activities.NeverRarelySometimesOftenAlwaysVisit Sina microblogs67.5%16.0%11.5%3.1%1.9%Engage with online communities66.1%16.7%12.4%3.0%1.8%Utilize social networking sites49.1%19.0%19.1%8.1%4.7%Obtain news and information online35.5%25.1%28.1%8.2%3.1%Support fan-based activities81.6%9.5%6.6%1.2%1.1%Express opinions on social events70.7%16.9%9.7%1.6%1.1%Discuss societal issues with others online71.8%15.9%9.8%1.5%1.0%Open in a new tabTable 3further demonstrates the status quo of students’ social media use and academic performance in different subgroups. The ANOVA results indicate that, compared to the reference group, female students with rural registration, enrolled in key schools, possessing a higher education level, and from a lower socioeconomic background exhibited a higher frequency of social media use. Meanwhile, those with urban registration, attending key schools, and from higher socioeconomic background showed relatively better academic performance. Moreover,Table 3also reveals a less pronounced gender disparity and school-based variations in students’ academic performance, which reflects the ongoing trend toward gender equality and the equitable distribution of educational resources. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that both social media use and academic performance still appear to be associated with family socioeconomic status, thereby suggesting an inherent characteristic of social stratification within the field of minors’ development. In the subsequent section, we continue to carry out in-depth quantitative analyses to elucidate the underlying mechanism linking social media use and academic performance among Chinese children and adolescents.Table 3.Subgroup distribution characteristics of social media use and academic performance.VariablesGroupingSocial Media UseAcademic PerformancenGenderMale1.57651.4453896Female1.70851.0834425ANOVA test resultp< 0.01p= 0.429Household registrationUrban1.55753.3564063Rural1.73149.2464258ANOVA test resultp< 0.01p< 0.01School attendedKey School1.68150.6933138Non-key School1.62551.5925183ANOVA test resultp< 0.01p= 0.056Education levelPrimary education1.28355.9013408Secondary education1.71648.9801998High School/technical school education2.02347.3772915ANOVA test resultp< 0.01p< 0.01Family socioeconomic statusHigh family socioeconomic status1.52954.1703630Low family socioeconomic status1.73748.9954691ANOVA test resultp< 0.01p< 0.01Open in a new tabNotes: The mean values of social media use and academic performance are reported. Family socioeconomic status was categorized into a high/low group based on this variable’s mean value. The significance level of the F test for group comparisons was determined using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and reported accordingly.4.2. Examination of Chain Mediation EffectsBy utilizing the PROCESS plug-in of SPSS and employing the bootstrapping method proposed by Hayes [54], we conducted a stepwise regression analysis to empirically examine the research hypotheses proposed above. The results are presented inTable 4. First of all, after controlling for other variables, Model 1 demonstrated a statistically significant positive impact of social media use on academic performance (regression coefficient = 1.676,p< 0.01). Thus, H1 was validated. Then, Model 2 and Model 3, respectively, investigated the impacts of social media use on the two mediating variables. The findings indicate a significant positive relationship between social media use and online learning behavior (regression coefficient = 0.397,p< 0.01), as well as a similar positive association with prosocial behavior (regression coefficient = 0.264,p< 0.01), thereby providing support for hypotheses H2a and H3a. Finally, both the core independent variable and mediating variables were incorporated into Model 4. We found that there were significant positive effects of online learning behavior (regression coefficient = 0.988,p< 0.01) and prosocial behavior (regression coefficient = 1.723,p< 0.01) on academic performance, which further verified H2b and H3b.Table 4.Stepwise regression analyses on the influencing paths of academic performance.VariablesModel 1(DV: Academic Performance)Model 2(DV: Online Learning Behavior)Model 3(DV: Prosocial Behavior)Model 4(DV: Academic Performance)Constant48.131 ***(1.507)1.675 ***(0.059)0.980 ***(0.096)44.048 ***(1.578)Gender (female = 0)−0.096(0.451)−0.061 ***(0.018)0.111 ***(0.027)−0.199(0.448)Household registration (rural = 0)1.062 **(0.505)0.014(0.020)−0.060 **(0.031)1.146 **(0.502)School attended (non-key school = 0)−0.399(0.470)−0.018(0.018)0.097 ***(0.029)−0.540(0.467)Education level (primary education = 0)Secondary education−6.498 ***(0.624)0.124 ***(0.024)0.187 ***(0.038)−6.998 ***(0.622)High school/technical school education−8.130 ***(0.642)0.056 **(0.025)0.152 ***(0.039)−8.472 ***(0.638)Parenting attitude0.911 ***(0.326)0.094 ***(0.013)0.189 ***(0.020)0.452(0.327)Family socioeconomic status0.039 ***(0.010)0.001(0.001)0.002 ***(0.001)0.035 ***(0.010)Social media use1.676 ***(0.364)0.397 ***(0.014)0.264 ***(0.023)0.655 *(0.381)Online learning behavior0.257 ***(0.017)0.988 ***(0.283)Prosocial behavior1.723 ***(0.179)R20.0420.1160.0800.056F value45.598 ***136.016 ***80.528 ***48.833 ***Open in a new tabNotes: The standard error of the non-standardized regression coefficient is presented in parentheses; * denotesp< 0.1, ** denotesp< 0.05, and *** denotesp< 0.01. DV = dependent variable.Based on the results of the stepwise regression analyses presented inTable 4, we proceeded to employ the bootstrap method to conduct 5000 rounds of random sampling to examine the mediating effects of online learning behavior and prosocial behavior. The indirect effects of mediation paths and their proportion to the total effect are reported inTable 5. The statistical results show that the specific paths, i.e., SMU → OLB → AP and SMU → PB → AP, accounted for 23.4% and 27.1% of the total effect, respectively. Furthermore, SMU also exhibited a chained mediating effect upon academic performance through OLB and PB, contributing to 10.4% of the total effect. In terms of the relative effect sizes, the direct effect accounted for 39.1% of the total effect, while the combined effect of the three mediating effects explained 60.9% of the total effect, surpassing that of the direct effect. As indicated by Model 4 inTable 4, the direct effect of SMU → AP was statistically significant (regression coefficient = 0.655,p< 0.1), suggesting that OLB, PB, and OLB → PB partially mediated the relationship between social media use and academic performance. In other words, social media use could not only directly improve students’ academic performance but also exert substantial indirect effects through these two mediating factors, which validated H2c and H3c. Thus, the proposed chain mediation model for this study was supported by empirical materials.Table 5.Decomposition of indirect effects of social media use on academic performance.Influence PathsIndirect Effect ValueBootstrap 95% CIPercentage (Indirect Effect/Total Effect)SMU → OLB → AP0.392[0.155, 0.631]23.4%SMU → PB → AP0.454[0.328, 0.598]27.1%SMU → OLB → PB → AP0.175[0.129, 0.227]10.4%Open in a new tabNotes: The total effect size was 1.676, with a bootstrap 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.962 to 2.391. SMU = social media use, OLB = online learning behavior, PB = prosocial behavior, AP = academic performance.4.3. Examination of the Moderating Effect of Family Socioeconomic StatusPrevious literature points out that family socioeconomic status might exert heterogeneous influence on individuals’ socialization process [50,51]. Hence, does the identified promoting effect of social media use on students’ academic performance differ based on variations in their family background? Next, we introduced an interaction term based on the above mediation model, designed to further explore the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status. As shown in Model 5 ofTable 6, the coefficient of the interaction term between family socioeconomic status and social media use was −0.032, with a bootstrap 95% confidence interval that did not include zero, indicating a statistically significant negative moderating effect. Therefore, H4 was supported.Table 6.Test results of the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status.DV: Academic PerformanceModel 5Bootstrap 95% CISocial media use1.591(0.525)[0.561, 2.620]Online learning behavior1.027(0.284)[0.471, 1.583]Prosocial behavior1.726(0.179)[1.375, 2.077]Family socioeconomic status0.088(0.023)[0.044, 0.133]Family socioeconomic status × social media use−0.032(0.012)[−0.056, −0.008]Other variablesYesOpen in a new tabNotes: The settings of other variables in this table remained consistent with those presented inTable 4. DV = dependent variable; CI = confidence interval.To visually depict the moderating role of family socioeconomic status and its influencing boundary more effectively, we further drew a simple slope diagram and a Johnson–Neyman conditional effect diagram. As shown inFigure 2, compared to those with a high family socioeconomic status (i.e., mean + standard deviation), the impact of social media use on academic performance seemed to be significantly more pronounced among students with a low family socioeconomic status (i.e., mean − standard deviation). This finding suggests that students with limited family educational resources could compensate by leveraging individual capital acquired through social media, thereby enhancing their academic performance. InFigure 3, the Johnson–Neyman method was employed to quantitatively assess the threshold interval of the significant moderating effect of family socioeconomic status. The results indicate that when the family socioeconomic status index fell below 26.276 (i.e., cumulative percentile from low to high at about 50.8%), the confidence interval for the conditional effect remained positive but gradually diminished. However, when the family socioeconomic status index exceeded 26.276, the confidence interval for the conditional effect began to include zero, indicating that the moderating effect within this statistical range was no longer statistically significant. Thus, it can be inferred that the importance of utilizing social media as a means to enhance academic performance is decreased for those belonging to higher socioeconomic backgrounds. In this sense, if we consider academic performance as one of the determinants of individual holistic development, then students from lower socioeconomic families may leverage the relatively stronger marginal utility derived from social media usage, thereby aiding in mitigating developmental inequalities faced by underprivileged children due to familial disadvantages.Figure 2.Open in a new tabThe simple slope diagram of family socioeconomic status.Figure 3.Open in a new tabJohnson–Neyman conditional effect diagram of social media use. 5. Conclusions, Implications, and Study Limitations5.1. ConclusionsAt present, the rapid proliferation and extensive application of digital technology have resulted in ubiquitous usage of social media platforms among school-aged children and adolescents worldwide. Admittedly, the openness of the cyber space evidently promotes educational fairness by providing children and adolescents with access to a wide range of learning resources, many of which are free. In light of this, the examination of social media’s impact on students’ academic development has emerged as a prominent topic in recent scholarly research. Drawing on data from the 2022 Chinese Minors’ Digital Life and Online Protection Survey, the current study empirically explored the status quo of social media use and its impact on academic performance among children and adolescents. By developing a moderated chain mediation model, we aimed to enrich our comprehension of the behavioral determinants influencing academic performance and contribute to addressing the issue of digital inequality in Chinese students’ educational advancement.This study employed multiple regression analysis and the bootstrapping test method to analyze the effects of Chinese students’ social media use, online learning behavior, and prosocial behavior on their academic performance. The main research findings are as follows: Firstly, the average level of social media use among Chinese children and adolescents was generally low, while their academic performance exhibited certain heterogeneity in terms of socio-demographic and schooling characteristics. Secondly, after controlling for other factors, the frequency of social media use had a significant positive impact on students’ academic performance. Thirdly, the mechanism analysis revealed that online learning behavior and prosocial behavior served as significant mediators in the relationship between social media use and academic performance. For instance, students could transfer their social media behavioral patterns to the internet-based learning context, and then effectively utilize remote learning resources. Furthermore, engagement with social media could cultivate individuals’ prosocial personality, thereby stimulating intrinsic motivation for learning and ultimately enhancing academic performance. Fourthly, the heterogeneity analysis further confirmed that the impact of social media use on students’ academic performance was stronger in lower-class families, underscoring the significant moderating role of family socioeconomic status in the relationship between social media use and academic performance.5.2. Theoretical and Practical ImplicationsFrom an academic standpoint, these findings make a theoretical contribution to the advancement of research in the domain of minors’ development. Specifically, by empirically validating the interplay among social media use, online learning behavior, and prosocial behavior, this study provides a novel analytical framework to comprehend the underlying mechanisms influencing students’ academic performance in the context of a digital society. In addition, the existing literature has highlighted disparities in the academic progress of children and adolescents stemming from their socioeconomic backgrounds [51], yet the potential functions arising from such disparities have remained inadequately explicated. By incorporating family socioeconomic status as a moderating variable, our study substantiates that the enhancing impact of social media use on academic performance tends to diminish with increases in the family socioeconomic status index. This finding reminds us that the rational utilization of social media could alleviate the familial disadvantages resulting from limited economic and cultural resources, thereby optimizing opportunities for upward social mobility among students hailing from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Lastly, this study underlines the growing significance of digital media’s social construction function, particularly in light of the evolution of artificial intelligence and new media technologies. Indeed, the virtual socialization process based on cyberspace has become a parallel mechanism to real-life socialization processes. In this sense, this article also offers valuable insights for further exploration of socialization theory applicable to the digital age.In view of the aforementioned empirical findings, we put forward the following policy recommendations. To begin with, it is crucial to actively enhance the policy support system aimed at providing high-quality online resources and fostering a conducive social environment for the rational utilization of social media by Chinese children and adolescents, considering their relatively limited engagement with such platforms. Policy makers should actively promote the establishment of relevant institutions to enhance the child-friendly features of social media. This will effectively curtail the dissemination of misinformation. Meanwhile, government departments should provide substantial support to digital literacy education programs, which will help enhance minors’ proficiency in utilizing social media as a means to acquire learning resources and foster knowledge-sharing habitus.Next, given the promotional effect of social media use on academic performance, both parents and teachers, as crucial agents of early socialization, should actively explore the effective integration of social media into educational activities. For instance, platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok can be effectively utilized to host online forums that facilitate the seamless sharing of educational resources between families and schools, exchange valuable educational experiences, and foster a consensus on education. These collaborative efforts have the potential to contribute significantly toward establishing a secure learning environment for minors. Additionally, school administrators ought to arrange regular training sessions to enhance the proficiency of teachers and parents in utilizing social media for educational purposes, encompassing the development and implementation of instructional activities based on social media as well as the management of students’ interactions within online learning environments [55,56,57].Furthermore, this study emphasizes the importance of online learning behavior and prosocial behavior as influential predictors of students’ academic performance. As such, parents may deliberately devise personalized training plans for their children’s online learning, aid in optimizing time allocation, and facilitate their children’s participation in offline social activities through online platforms. They also need to actively participate in their children’s digital lives with a more responsible and inclusive attitude, thereby facilitating students’ better adaptation to the digital transformation of learning modes. To summarize, parents of varying socioeconomic backgrounds should acknowledge the benefits of networked social media on shaping a well-rounded personality and strive to explore a collaborative mechanism that integrates education and entertainment, which may help to effectively promote individuals’ comprehensive development.5.3. Limitations and ProspectsThere are still some limitations to this study. First, given that the statistical analyses in this article rely on cross-sectional survey data, it is challenging to establish causal relationships between the variables. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a longitudinal research design to reaffirm the robustness of the research findings. Second, the measurements of certain variables are not rigorous due to the limitation of questionnaire data, which may compromise the precision of research findings. Third, in the analysis of mechanisms, this study primarily focuses on elucidating the mediating role of individual behavioral factors, specifically online learning and prosocial behavior. However, it does not delve into exploring the intricate interplay among individuals, school environment, and peer groups, which may exert multifaceted influences on students’ academic performance. In future investigations, we will endeavor to overcome the above-mentioned limitations in order to attain a more precise comprehension of the heterogeneous mechanisms connecting social media use and academic performance among children and adolescents."

        "Title": "A Systematic Literature Review of Soft Skills in Information Technology Education",
        "Abstract": "AbstractThis research addresses the importance of the soft skills approach, which encompasses problem-solving, collaboration, interpersonal and communication skills for higher education in the information technology (IT) field. IT graduate students continue to face difficulties in meeting the employability criteria of the global information technology sector due to mismatching capabilities, such as the discrepancy between the technical knowledge obtained in academia and the practical skills expected by employers. This systematic literature review used PRISMA guidelines for data collection. Papers were examined using the inclusion–exclusion criteria, which included concentrating on full-text studies about soft skills in higher education published in English between 2018 and 2024. The keywords used by the inclusion and exclusion criteria are soft skills, higher education, university, undergraduate, graduate, IT, information technology, software, computer science, programming, information systems and IS. The SCOPUS search engine platform found 2088 documents, and the (WOS) database obtained 1383 documents. To comprehend the significance of soft skills in the field and its effect on graduates’ employability, 69 papers were carefully examined. The rapid change following Industrial Revolution 4.0 has transformed the working environment, challenging new IT graduates to be competent in the working environment. This study highlights the importance of soft skills and self-awareness in university education, revealing that current curricula must adapt to the rapidly changing job market, especially post Industry 4.0. The literature review indicates that despite high technical competence, graduates lack essential soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, creating a gap between new graduates and industry expectations. Hopefully, this study’s results will contribute to understanding the functionality and necessity of soft skills in the behavioral sciences literature. To bridge the skills gap between industry demands and technical proficiency, academic institutions should incorporate creative teaching approaches prioritizing soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Universities, recent graduates, and companies must work together to modify courses to meet the needs of a job market that is changing quickly.Keywords:soft skills, higher education, IT education, industry",
        "Sections": "1. IntroductionTraditional learning methodologies in higher education (HE) are at odds with the changing workforce requirements. Numerous studies show that university graduates lack important abilities such as interpersonal communication, social skills, creativity, and project execution [1,2]. This underlines the critical importance of developing 21st-century skills for global economic involvement and professional competence. According to Draaijer et al., the graduation averages incorrectly forecast students’ future professional success in work placements [3,4]. Employability is emphasized in higher education because of the possible economic risks associated with rising unemployment rates, a common concern in developed and developing countries [5,6]. The literature divides learned skills into cognitive and non-cognitive (soft skills). Non-cognitive skills are attitudes that affect how individuals approach learning and interact with people around them [7]. As stated by other researchers, the most prominent features of soft skills are emotional awareness, positivity, interaction, people management, conflict management, strategic thinking and fast learning skills. In contrast, numerical, language and data literacy skills are not specific to soft skills [8].Emotional intelligence is an important skill that forms the basis of soft skills. Emotional intelligence’s self-awareness and self-management components contribute positively to skills such as leadership and problem-solving [9]. Thanks to their emotional intelligence, individuals working in technology can communicate better, increase their problem-solving abilities, and be more effective in innovative thinking. For example, major technology companies such as Google and Microsoft view emotional intelligence as an important competency for leadership and team management [8].Emotional soft skills are critical for success in the workplace and social life because they improve individuals’ ability to cope with stress, adapt to change, and communicate effectively in complex social environments [10]. These skills enable employees to be more productive and adaptable, especially in the technology sector, which requires intense workloads and complex project management. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has also developed a framework stating that social–emotional skills are critical in cooperation, task performance, emotional regulation, and open-mindedness. According to this framework, sub-skills such as tolerance and sociability are also included in these areas. The literature shows that emotional skills are important in academic success, career-related decision-making self-efficacy, and rapport with colleagues [11].In addition, another concept that comes to mind when soft skills are mentioned is emotional intelligence. Especially in technology, emotional intelligence is the key to success [12]. Individuals with developed emotional intelligence can collaborate comfortably and have the skills to be good leaders. Individuals who know and manage their emotions can make good choices and perform better. If employees in the field of technology can remain calm and positive, a more comfortable working environment can be realized. In addition, stronger teams are established by bringing together individuals with empathy skills. Empathy plays a critical role in conflict management and adaptation in technology teams. Individuals with developed empathy skills strengthen communication within the team and can produce more creative solutions for projects. It increases the cooperation of teams and creates a stronger and more productive working environment [13]. The Adults Online Course platform training emphasized that “Emotional intelligence is as important as technical skills in the technology sector”.Bhat and Gupta state that critical thinking, communication, creativity and collaboration (4Cs) are soft skills and are complex and vital factors affecting employers’ productivity. The researchers also emphasized that the soft skills that are increasingly scarce in the workforce are “compassion and understanding”, “feedback”, “motivation”, “collaboration synergy”, “practical knowledge”, “interpersonal skills”, and “team culture” [14]. Soft skills are personal qualities, habits, attitudes and social courtesies that make individuals good employees and suitable for work. Also, soft skills are personal qualities that improve individuals’ interaction skills, job performance and career prospects. In other words, subtle behaviors and communication styles make managing a work environment or interacting with another person easier [15].In today’s higher education, the system often focuses on students learning theoretical knowledge, while the practical application of the learned knowledge is sometimes overlooked. For this reason, students cannot effectively use the knowledge they have learned when they start their professional lives. The education system should not only transfer knowledge but also practice using this knowledge.Two hundred academics and experts participated in the “Building Tomorrow’s Talent” study sponsored by Workday. According to the results of this study, employers care more about interpersonal skills than the GPA on the transcript. Some universities have started to indicate the skills of their graduates on their transcripts [16]. Similarly, Vleuten from Maastricht University stated that students’ inability to apply what they learn in practice is a fundamental problem of education.Another study in Finland illustrates that the impact of generic skills in education is challenging [17]. Therefore, the various academic programs require a specific model design. Moreover, the necessity of an analytical self-assessment process is vital. Tsortanidou states that collaboration, problem-solving skills, and creativity are among the skills targeted in the twenty-first century [18]. Furthermore, Gretter and Yadav have stated that for individuals to acquire these skills, students should be creators rather than gaining specific knowledge [19]. It is specified that improving these skills should be included in the current culture. Graduates’ lack of soft skills seems to be the fundamental reason causing unemployment. The unemployment of new university graduates can cause social distress and psychological complications in the long term, as stated by researchers [20].Many researchers state that IT workers do not have the soft skills required by the digital age as much as they desire and, therefore, have difficulty joining the workforce [21,22,23]. Other researchers also state that no matter how good the technical knowledge and competencies are, the lack of sufficient soft skills creates incompatibility with changing job demands and duties [21,24].In Hong Kong, IT has been declared a priority development industry. In addition, a business field called “new collar” has been defined, and it is stated that technical knowledge and soft skills must be at a good level in this field [25]. In a statement made by the University of Pennsylvania, it was specified that students who study computer science in the learning process with new learning approaches could be successful if they have skills such as time management, a willingness to cooperate, being determined, and not being afraid to seek for help [3].A fundamental role of computer scientists is to produce solutions through collaborative problem-solving with programmers, IT experts, and mechanical or software engineers [26]. However, Flavin emphasizes in his report on necessary computer science abilities that technical knowledge alone is insufficient, emphasizing soft skills considerably [27]. These critical success factors include communication, teamwork, presentation, self-awareness, and professionalism, linked to essential personality traits and abilities developed by experience and practice. Another study by Grover and Pea argues that programming goes beyond code to include self-expression [28]. Furthermore, Varela states that individuals must have adaptive, change-sensitive problem-solving skills to succeed in changing global settings, including software and hardware creation [29]. World-renowned organizations, such as the OECD and UNESCO, are actively exploring the skills required for 2030. These organizations demand that higher education institutions (HEIs) support national, international, and industrial curriculum reforms that promote quality, flexibility, and lifelong learning from a sustainability standpoint.In a study conducted by Dobslaw et al. in Sweden in 2023, they performed a trend analysis of technology in job postings over the last six years. As a result of the study, they revealed that the demand for cloud and automation technologies such as Kubernetes and Docker has increased in job postings. Still, these topics are not sufficient in higher education curricula. The researchers stated that there are differences between higher education curricula and job postings, that while concepts are emphasized more in universities, technologies are mentioned in the IT industry. They suggested that future studies should include research that includes soft skills [30].The impact of soft skills development on the workplace is multifaceted, especially for IT professionals [31]. Effective communication and determining solutions in IT projects depend on teamwork and cooperation. Teams that collaborate effectively also increase customer relationships, thus increasing customer satisfaction [31,32]. As seen in the literature, changes in the information technology (IT) field increase the importance of soft skills. Although technical skills are indispensable in the IT industry, it is understood that qualified soft skills are equally important for individual and team success [33]. At the same time, work environments that encourage creativity enable the development of new technology and increase efficiency in business processes [34,35]. In addition, a high level of soft skills increases employees’ motivation, controls stress management and improves social relations.This study aims to investigate the role of soft skills in IT higher education and assess its impact on the employability of graduates in the IT industry. With an increasing demand for proficient and well-equipped IT professionals, universities face pressure and challenges to produce graduates with relevant skills. However, mismatches in skills and a lack of soft skills have become barriers for IT students entering the employment workforce. We recognize the potential of soft skills to bridge this gap and mitigate the unemployment rate. This research identifies trends in soft skills elements within studies conducted for information technology students.As mentioned above, soft skills are one of the determining factors for the success of IT employees. The changing dynamics of the IT industry expect employees to have both technical knowledge and practical knowledge, collaboration, time management and communication skills at a sufficient level in soft skills. In higher education institutions, it is seen that these demands are not sufficiently focused on meeting, and graduates have difficulties in their professional lives. For this reason, examining the research conducted on these skills in higher education institutions’ curricula is important from an industrial and academic perspective. This review identifies a gap in the literature and a lack of comprehensive studies combining and analyzing the results in this context. The research questions guiding this investigation are as follows:Which specific soft skills have been the primary focus in studies developed for students undergoing IT education?What challenges or difficulties have been encountered in developing and implementing soft skills studies for IT students?What recommendations or suggestions emerge from studies focusing on developing soft skills for students in IT education programs?What are the emerging trends in fostering soft skills in IT education?These research questions aim to comprehensively recognize the impact, challenges, and recommendations associated with soft skills in information technology education. 2. Research MethodologyStudies that evaluate research found in the literature are called review articles. In review articles, the relevant literature is carefully identified and synthesized. Review articles provide future researchers with an advanced understanding of the topic and help identify research gaps. There are review studies based on different methods, including bibliometric reviews, narrative reviews, scoping reviews, systematic literature reviews, and meta-analyses [36]. In cases where it is impossible to obtain homogeneous data sets across different types of studies, systematic literature studies using the meta-analysis method are more appropriate for qualitatively evaluating general trends and theoretical frameworks.The study was planned to answer the determined research questions using PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items and Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis), which is widely used in systematic literature reviews [37].A systematic literature review is the process of identifying and critically evaluating the studies in the literature on the subject, as well as collecting and analyzing data from the identified studies [37]. Since the inclusion and exclusive criteria are determined in advance in the systematic literature review, bias in the results can be kept to a minimum [38].2.1. Search StrategyScopus and WOS are common search engines used for academic literature searches in terms of the coverage of scientific journals, conference proceedings, and books in the peer-reviewed literature [39]. In addition, Scopus and WOS have become preferred databases because they mostly list journals with high-impact factors and have an understandable and simple interface [40].To achieve the objectives of the systematic literature review, the appropriate classification was evaluated and categorized according to the context. The study’s authors searched the databases by determining a set of keyword combinations. This query technique uses Boolean logic, which uses keywords and phrases related to the topic with the combination operators AND, OR, and NOT to eliminate the wide area of the topic by a certain period.The research keywords were determined according to the given criteria: “Soft skills”, “higher education”, “university”, “undergraduate”, “graduate”, “IT”, “Information Technologies”, “software”, “computer science”, “programming”, “information systems”, and “IS”. The research conducted with these keywords includes those published between 2018 and 2024 that are open access and in English. The identified keywords were scanned in the “Title-Abs-Key” field of the SCOPUS database and the “Topic” field of the WoS database. These fields perform the scan, which includes the title, the abstract and the keywords of the studies.WOS and Scopus have easy-to-use filtering features. The filters have been made by the inclusive and exclusive criteria using the formula given below:(TITLE-ABS-KEY(“Soft skills”)AND TITLE-ABS-KEY((“higher education”OR“university”OR“undergraduate”OR“Graduate”))AND TITLE-ABS-KEY((“IT”OR“Information Technologies”OR“Software”OR“ComputerScience”OR“Programming”OR“Information Systems”OR“IS”)))AND(LIMIT-TO(OA,“all”))AND(LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2024)OR LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2023)OR LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2022)OR LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2021)OR LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2020)OR LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2019)OR LIMIT-TO(PUBYEAR,2018))AND(LIMIT-TO(DOCTYPE,“ar”))AND(LIMIT-TO(LANGUAGE,“English”))AND(LIMIT-TO(SRCTYPE,“j”))2.2. Searching Criteria and VariablesThe inclusion and exclusion criteria narrow the broader topic to a more reliable context, emphasizing the study’s credibility and validity.Table 1displays all the variables included and excluded in this study.Table 1.Inclusion and exclusion criteria.CharacteristicInclusiveExclusiveContextSoft Skills in HEIDocuments which do not include soft skills in HEITypeJournalsMagazineEssaysReportsBooksProceeding papersTime2018–2024Before 2018LanguageEnglishNon-EnglishAvailabilityOpen accessAccess denied or chargeableOpen in a new tabThe database search selection has commenced with 3471 articles. Then, two thousand eighty-eight articles were found in the SCOPUS database search engine. Also, one thousand three hundred eighty-three papers were found on the Web of Science, a published papers collection search platform. The journal publications were checked from 2018 to the present date. Nevertheless, many papers were excluded following PRISMA’s examination process for several reasons, such as duplicated papers, books, conference proceedings, reports, and magazines. Also, the open access articles are included. The language was filtered to English to avoid wasting time translating (Figure 1).Figure 1.Open in a new tabAn illustration of the phases of the PRISMA diagram of a systematic literature review. Source: Page et al. [41].Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 243 articles were accessed in WoS, and 308 published articles were found in the SCOPUS search engine platform. According to the PRISMA process, 175 duplicated papers were eliminated (duplicates were removed using the Mendeley 1.19.18 software’s basic functions). It followed the screening process of abstracts, of which 257 papers were excluded, since it was not related directly to the subject area of the study. Then, from the eligibility phase of the PRISMA process, another 15 papers were omitted because of the different language publications, and 35 full papers were eliminated because the results were not fit for the research questions. The total number of articles included in this systematic literature review is 69.Both authors independently assessed abstracts and titles for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors extracted data independently using a standard Excel form for the risk of bias and applicability assessment. The writers’ concordance index (Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient) was 0.91. 3. Literature ReviewJournal papers from the last six years, 2018–2024, were examined. The table below presents the themes of soft skills obtained from the articles included in the study’s scope (Table 2).Table 2.Themes related to soft skills and main results.Soft Skills Challenges and Gaps[42]—Finland and ItalyIT engineering graduates have technical talents but struggle with social and communication skills.Cooperation, relationships, and expectations all present difficulties for recent graduates.[43]—SpainRemote learning affects soft skill development, including technological challenges, learning environments, and interpersonal skills.[44]—MoroccoThe relevance of soft skills is emphasized in the correlation between self-learning flipped classrooms and educational performance.[45]—PortugalAs a result of COVID-19, remote learning has become a phenomenon, including technical difficulties, learning circumstances, and interpersonal skills.[46]—IrelandConcerns about job opportunities and the need for the early incorporation of soft skills into higher education curricula because of the recent pandemic.[47]—MalaysiaDominant elements of soft communication and teamwork skills are high and are a bonus for employment.

ResultsThe following arguments and discussions of this systematic literature review results are based on the research questions. This literature review results illustrate a growing concern about the mismatch between the new educational program, employment requirements, and working industry guidelines.4.1. Significant Soft Skills Emphasized in IT EducationThe study of soft skills in IT education reveals several interests. Various approaches and strategies have stressed the importance of intra-personality, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities.Soft skills are becoming increasingly important in IT education, molding students’ competencies and ensuring their readiness for a dynamic labor market. This extensive analysis explores numerous researchers from worldwide focusing on developing and integrating soft skills in IT education. Studies in IT education have repeatedly revealed a wide range of soft skills deemed necessary for IT students. Based on the findings of the data compilation, specific soft skills that have been recurring crucial topics in this research include:Communication skills: A consistent emphasis in many studies has been placed on communication skills. Researchers have assessed intra-personality, impression control, and interpersonal competencies in an engineering environment using the Business-focused Inventory of Personality (BIP) [82].Teamwork and cooperation: This vital element has been identified as a key ability for information technology professionals. Researchers used the Multinational, Intercultural, Multidisciplinary, and Intensive (MIMI) technique to help computer science students improve their teamwork skills [62].Problem-solving and critical thinking: Problem-solving and critical thinking abilities are frequently highlighted. Other research studies stress the relevance of problem-solving in the educational preparation of IT students and the essentials of the critical thinking process [50,71].Adaptability and flexibility: The IT industry’s dynamic nature needs adaptability and flexibility. Other researchers emphasize the importance of students adapting to changes and demonstrating flexibility in their approaches [83,84].Leadership skills: Leadership abilities have been identified in various investigations. The authors emphasized the necessity for hard and soft skills, especially leadership, for Thai vocational students [85]. There is a strong correlation between university education skills taught in enhancing students’ leadership skills, self-confidence and decision-making in the job environment [58].Intrapersonal skills and self-awareness: Intrapersonal skills are recognized, including self-awareness. Researchers developed a theoretical hybrid model with AI features to measure students’ soft skills [86].Ethics and moral values: This section investigates the ethical dimensions of soft skills. Zabidi et al. explored the incorporation of ethical and moral principles into educational institutions, focusing on the socio-cultural impact on skill development [87].Creativity and innovation: It is considered a highly valued quality skill. Game-based learning (GBL) was used in studies to improve students’ inventiveness and creative thinking [88,89].Socio-emotional skills: Socio-emotional skills are highlighted, especially emotional intelligence. During the COVID-19 pandemic, teaching and learning in South American countries emphasized the need for self-awareness skills [90]. Also, emotional engagement is crucial and positively impacts IT students to demonstrate tasks online as digital learning becomes a phenomenon [65].Self-control and time management: Both elements are measured as a necessity, because of the importance of active learning, communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking [91].Motivation and curiosity: Motivation and curiosity are encouraged for continual learning. Researchers investigated skills supplied to employers for fresh graduate skill competencies, focusing on willingness and analytical analysis [92]. Individual students from the IT field must expect some requirements of personally guided experience [93].Business and entrepreneurial Talents: Researchers emphasized the importance of partnership between students and industry through an entrepreneurial program [94]. Theoretically, outstanding IT students with managerial skills are capable and crucial conditions for the performance of the company when they are employed, as stated by [57]Interpersonal skills: Interpersonal skills are handled constantly in the literature. Researchers examined employers’ perceptions of graduate students’ soft skills, specifically interpersonal, problem-solving, moral, ethical, self-management, and thinking abilities [95].Cognitive skills: Skills such as critical thinking and analytical cognition are continuously emphasized. Lin and Yo created a theoretical framework to evaluate undergraduate courses by incorporating characteristics of soft skills such as leadership, communication, and reasoning [96]. In the current digital era of teaching, recognizing the factors that influence learning to motivate students is vital [66].Willingness to Learn: The common theme is the enthusiasm to learn. Ref. [69] investigated the soft skills required by Malaysia’s engineering industry, concentrating on interpersonal, intrapersonal, and business abilities.These results highlight the heterogeneous yet linked nature of soft skills in IT education, underlining their critical role in developing well-rounded and adaptive IT professionals. As detailed in this comprehensive report, the investigation of soft skills in IT education demonstrates a global understanding of their growing importance in developing well-rounded and flexible professionals for the dynamic labor market. The highlighted soft skills range from communication and teamwork to problem-solving and leadership, forming diverse yet interrelated aspects. These are critical for success in the ever-changing IT business. Including empirical evidence from several studies strengthens the legitimacy of these assertions. Although, focusing on practical approaches, such as game-based learning and the MIMI technique, provides a tangible dimension to the discussion.Furthermore, other factors included ethical components and socio-emotional skills in a worldwide pandemic era. Also, the multifaceted nature of self-control and time management emphasizes the nuanced and holistic approach required for soft skill development. This list reflects the current status of soft skills in IT education. However, it acts as a valuable resource for educators, students, and industry stakeholders navigating the complex environment of educating IT workers toward success.4.2. Exploring Barriers to IT Students’ Development of Soft SkillsThe difficulties experienced in soft skills studies for IT students are multifaceted and can be summarized as follows:Communication and relationship-building challenges: The Business-focused Inventory of Personality (BIP) model revealed that IT students, particularly engineering students, struggle to develop personal relationships and communicate effectively [82]. According to researchers, 90% of CS/IT students lack the problem-solving and critical analytical-thinking skills necessary for effective communication and relationship-building [71]. The study conducted by Caggiano and his colleagues stated that while information technology engineering graduates had sufficient technical skills, they had difficulty with social and communication skills [42]. This result, which emphasizes the importance of emotional skills in one’s professional life, shows that employees need to develop not only technical skills but also social skills that include emotional skills.The gap between industry expectations and university education: According to researchers, while industry and employment believe IT graduates are well-equipped with technical abilities, the transition to work frequently fails due to a lack of the life-long learning of soft skills [47]. The absence of collaboration between colleges, universities, and the IT sector has hindered the understanding career requirements following graduation [50].Teamwork and gender differences: Researchers observed difficulty developing group assignments in database administration due to gender inequalities, which impacted teamwork experiences [47].Entrepreneurship skills and integration: Adding entrepreneurship skills to the school curriculum is difficult because it is based on individual traits [97]. However, in higher education institutions (HEIs), students can learn about entrepreneurship.Impact of COVID-19 on soft skills gap: The soft skills gap has widened since the COVID-19 pandemic because of fast-changing surroundings, which cause IT students to be oblivious to industry developments [98].Resistance to curriculum redesign: Including soft skills in the IT curriculum may necessitate program modification and additional work to attain learning outcomes in core course modules [50].Difficulty in online soft skills teaching: Due to demographic and technical considerations, applying a soft skills approach to online teaching and learning post-COVID-19 is difficult [43]. Distance learning processes can create difficulties in terms of the development of students’ emotional skills such as self-regulation and motivation. In order to overcome these difficulties, activities that support emotional intelligence should be included. A combination of face-to-face and eLearning can minimize the gap of soft skills issues which prepare classes that students can engage and interact with independently and be motivated toward learning, as stated by [81].Industry blaming educational institutions: The industry accuses higher education institutions (HEIs) of failing to prepare students with the requisite soft skills, resulting in a lack of initiative [99].Challenges in developing countries: Low-level soft skills in underdeveloped nations such as Bangladesh are difficult to promote due to social inequality, the digital divide, and a lack of initiative by education officials [83].Hard skills are prioritized over soft skills: Despite the industry’s emphasis on soft skills, there has been little effort to incorporate them into educational programs [99].Job market challenges: The rapidly changing engineering and IT job market presents obstacles for graduates who may fail to match changing skill requirements [100].Soft skills studies have a limited scope: Researchers emphasized the limitations of a Hong Kong study that examined only five soft skills for graduate students in the technology field [92].Need for co-curricular courses: According to researchers, co-curricular courses focus on communication, which can improve teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership skills [101].Integration of cognitive and emotional skills: To satisfy industry requirements, integrating social, spiritual, and emotional skills into the education curriculum is essential [102].In summary, the difficulties in soft skills studies for IT students are caused by some variables, including communication difficulties, opposition to curriculum revision, the gaps between industry expectations and the education system, and unique challenges to the online teaching and learning process. Addressing these vital issues would require coordination among educational institutions, industry players, and policymakers.Technical challenges: Distance learning involves technical and interpersonal difficulties [43,45]. Students often struggle with developing emotional skills, particularly self-regulation and motivation, in this context. Educators must incorporate activities and practices that foster emotional intelligence into their distance education programs.4.3. The Suggestions Made for the IT Students’ Soft Skills DevelopmentSeveral kinds of research on soft skills development for students in IT education provide useful recommendations. Caggiano et al. state that soft skills and cooperation training are necessary for collaboration tasks, especially in the engineering and science departments [82]. According to Lousa and Lousa, the impact of COVID-19 on students’ opinions of the Portuguese education system reveals lessons for policymakers [45]. Also, Siddo states that soft skills requirements differ across IT and non-IT businesses, with the former emphasizing technical skills and the latter stressing teamwork and personal attitudes [51]. Furthermore, Dowdall argues for implementing the MIMI methodology to improve computer science students’ collaboration and communication skills [62].Project-based learning (PBL) is an important technique for developing soft skills. Dogara et al. discovered that PBL improves technical students’ teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills [59]. Also, Idris describes the e-colloquium as a platform for enhancing presentation, mental preparedness, and communication abilities [60]. Adamuthe and Patil suggest a roadmap for sophisticated problem-solving in CS/IT students, focusing on industry expertise and problem-solving methodologies [71].Various learning methodologies are proposed to improve soft skills. Mitchell and Vaughan recommend team-based learning (TBL) for database classes to improve teamwork and performance [47]. On the other hand, Mgaiwa emphasizes the necessity of collaboration between universities and the IT industry in aligning education with industry demands [50]. To handle coursework loads and improve efficiency, mixing physical and mental activities into the curriculum is recommended [34].Several technological platforms and paradigms assist the development of soft skills. The Passport online platform model allows for a self-reporting evaluation, improving IT industry-related soft skills and lifetime learning [77]. In the internship programs, the Rogaine Model minimizes gender gaps and promotes motivation. Gamification approaches and flipped classrooms are advocated for in terms of fostering engagement, motivation, and self-management abilities [44,88].Several studies underline the importance of collaboration between academia and industry. Succi and Wieandt emphasize industry involvement in soft skills development [99]; however, Fitriani and Ajayi advocate for practical training programs to bridge the education–employment gap [69]. Internships and enterprise collaboration are important in improving graduate employability [94,103].Said-Hung et al. highlights soft skills’ relevance in reconstructing social interactions and boosting university students’ performance in the post-pandemic educational landscape [43]. The Authentic Learning Scenario (ALS) approach is proposed to improve employability and develop a competitive academic profile [104].Ultimately, these studies urge for incorporating long-term soft skills into IT education using a variety of methodologies such as (PBL), (TBL), industry engagement, technological platforms, and post-pandemic adaptability. They underline the importance of encouraging teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and adaptability, highlighting that these long-term skills are critical for students to thrive in the changing IT industry [77]. This viewpoint fits with the rising realization that a sustainable attitude and important soft skills are critical for handling modern difficulties and contributing to the IT sector’s long-term viability.4.4. Emerging Soft Skills Trends in IT EducationThis study reveals notable workforce development trends, such as a global emphasis on soft skills among IT students and engineers. A significant knowledge gap exists between graduate expertise and employer expectations. Therefore, the roles of industry participation and project-based learning in shaping HE programs to meet changing employment are critical.Global Emphasis on Soft Skills: Engineers have excellent technical talents but struggle with social and communication skills. Fresh graduates struggle with cooperation, relationships, and expectations [82]. A clear knowledge gap occurs between graduate students’ expertise and employer expectations. The relevance of soft skills in addressing employment difficulties is emphasized [105]. Results are tailored to job requirements, highlighting personal knowledge, critical thinking, and innovation [67]. Soft skills development is influenced by remote learning, which includes technical challenges, learning circumstances, and interpersonal skills [45]. The HE institutions attempt to prepare Z-generation graduates equipped with hard skills. However, there is less attention to soft skills in technical and science courses such as engineering and IT [75].Industry participation is critical in creating higher education programs to suit the changing demands of the employment market. A study by Siddo in Thailand noted that collaboration between IT experts and academics can considerably influence curriculum design, ultimately improving job opportunities for graduates [51]. In addition, this survey highlighted an awareness gap among educational institutions about industry requirements, underlining the necessity for stronger relations between academics and the industry. Similarly, Noah and Aziz’s study in Malaysia focused on enhancing the Teaching of English as a Second Language (TESL) program, which presented the importance of increasing graduates’ employability and soft skills [61]. The outcomes of this study provide significant insights for the reform of curricula in higher education institutions. This extreme shift implies that incorporating soft skills is important; nonetheless, it requires a gradual and well-planned transformation in legal education procedures.Project-based learning is considered a driving force in strengthening students’ soft skills in the education system. A study by Dogara et al. in Nigeria highlights the reasonable influence of such learning on technical students’ soft skills, stressing communication, initiative, and problem-solving [106]. While emphasizing these advantages, the study discloses a surprising finding: Information and communication technology (ICT) disadvantages soft skill development. This viewpoint stresses the need to thoroughly recognize the factors influencing soft skills acquisition in project-based learning. These findings are useful for educators and policymakers seeking to improve learning methodologies for holistic skills development.Several studies focused on the critical need for curriculum changes in higher education. Brennan conducted a study in Ireland highlighting the concern of employment shortage, underlining the importance of early incorporation of soft skills into curricula [46]. A Teaching of English as a Second Language (TESL) program in Malaysia is critical for better employability and soft skills [61]. Their observations can help with curriculum redesign in higher education institutions (HEIs). Concurrently, ref. [107], an Australian study, reveals redesign complexity difficulties, pointing to a worsening unemployment gap due to insufficient student and graduate industry engagement. The study advocates for a triangle collaboration among educators, industry, and students to successfully embed important soft skills into curricula, meeting the changing job market requirements. Moreover, in line with sustainability goals, including soft skills in curricula prepares students for urgent employment needs and adds to graduates’ long-term resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing and sustainable job market. This comprehensive strategy assures that educational systems nurture technical proficiency and a long-term perspective for dealing with global concerns. 5. Discussion and ConclusionsThis study demonstrated the literature on the soft skills approach in HEI in the IT field. The courses taught at universities require thorough investigation and new quality teaching techniques must overcome and replace traditional teaching. There is a high demand for students in the CS/IT field in the employment industry, especially after the industrial revolution 4.0. Unfortunately, graduates are well equipped in technical skills, not social aspects. The impact of hard skills has made it impossible to focus on the communication and management characteristics of the working environment. The fast development changes in the working industry and the industry revolution 4.0 have transformed the working environment rapidly and unexpectedly. This swift change in the working environment created a gap between fresh graduate students’ working industry environment. The literature has revealed that hard skills knowledge is inadequate to prepare students to enter the modern labor market. The current online teaching scenario has weakened students’ ability to connect and transform themselves into industry professionals. The issue of soft skills is widening the gap following the COVID-19 pandemic. New graduates with low soft skills are failing to make an impact in the new job market. The strategic design of pedagogy is essential in supporting students, despite the complexity of the model.Resources beyond the capacity of a sole institute are required to solve this issue. In this case, all three stakeholders, namely, the universities, new graduates, and employers, must cooperate to bridge the gap already widened by the pandemic, as the modern workplace environment requires non-academic courses. However, additional practice during undergraduate study enhances the capability of students to be more competitive for employment. Several methods and models are mentioned in the literature to explain the issue of soft skills elements for HEIs and the working industry. The literature has found three vital aspects of soft skills: communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These significantly empower IT graduates to access the new digital working environment in this IR 4.0 era. The HEIs must collaborate with the industry’s job requirements, because there are various forms of IT industry and non-IT industries concerning the soft skills requirements of employment. The MIMI method is beneficial for CS/IT students in developing teamwork and communication skills. In addition, emotional intelligence and soft skills must be developed when training future managers. In management positions in the IT field, the impact of emotional intelligence on leadership and decision-making skills is of great importance. In such courses, managers should be taught the skills to motivate their teams, communicate effectively in times of crisis, and develop empathy.Also, running additional educational activities that support students in problem-solving issues is essential, along with other approaches mentioned in the literature. In addition, when training future managers, it is necessary to develop emotional intelligence and soft skills. In management positions in the IT field, the impact of emotional intelligence on leadership and decision-making skills is of great importance. In such courses, managers should be taught the skills to motivate their teams, communicate effectively in times of crisis, and develop empathy, including flipped-classroom combinations, game-based learning, problem-based learning, SSTP, and real problem-solving scenarios, adopting cognitive, social intelligence, and work-placement programs. Also, making arrangements in IT department curricula to develop emotional skills will enable learners to be more successful in their professional lives.Two important factors raised in the literature are that students must be flexible and adaptable. Interestingly, the entrepreneurship scheme for university students before graduation by organizations is valuable for the smooth transition of graduates to employment. In return, the government is reducing the tax on selected companies offering students entrepreneurships.Other notable points found in this systematic literature review are the lack of social justice and the digital divide in developing countries, which increase the unemployment rate of IT graduates.Summarizing the systematic literature review results, soft skills are critical in information technology education. Soft skills shape student competencies and are one of the indications that they are not prepared for the labor market. According to the results obtained, leadership, problem-solving, socio-emotional skills, motivation, interpersonal communication, self-management and motivation soft skills are necessary for information technology students in many studies. Learners’ success in their future professional lives can be ensured by integrating the essential soft skills into the curriculum of educational institutions for employees with the qualifications that employers seek in the workforce. Another indication is difficulties such as the lack of interpersonal communication skills of learners in IT education, differences between industry expectations and the education provided in universities, difficulties in teamwork, difficulties caused by the gender variable, and the failure to integrate entrepreneurial skills into the curriculum. In addition, it has been revealed that education policymakers resist updating the curriculum, the industry blames universities for this issue, and the inadequacies in developing countries are prioritized over other skills instead of soft skills. These problems may cause learners to have difficulty adapting to their work lives and increase unemployment rates in the long term. Researchers may recommend that learners develop new learning–teaching models by addressing the challenges in developing soft skills.Another research aim is to determine the suggestions in the literature for developing soft skills. The results underscore the importance of learning approaches such as project-based learning and collaborative learning. These approaches can create awareness for all stakeholders and foster constructive cooperation between universities and industry. The research also reveals that practical education applications can close the education–employment gap. Initiatives by policymakers to provide internship opportunities in the sector are also seen as a significant contributor. By systematically updating education policies and promoting the integration of soft skills into the education system, policymakers and practitioners can play a crucial role in providing a competitive advantage in the labor market and enhancing the flexibility capacity of the national workforce.Another important result obtained is that Project-Based Learning is a learning approach that can significantly impact the development of many soft skills of learners. This finding should instill hope in educators and policymakers regarding this approach’s potential to shape the future of IT education. However, the factors hindering soft skill development must be analyzed well to implement this approach effectively.Integrating sustainability skills into IT education programs, along with soft skills, can help learners understand environmental and social responsibility behaviors and develop individuals who promote sustainable practices in the business world.It is worth mentioning that this review’s limitations have to do with the literature’s sample size. The articles were collected on two well-known database platforms, Web of Science and SCOPUS. However, some of the papers were not accessible due to fee charges. Also, the collected articles were limited because only two database platforms were used in this study. Additional sources such as IEEE Xplore, EBSCO, and other field databases can be included in future studies to provide more diversity in the systematic literature review.Finally, this study highlights the importance of soft skills in IT education settings, illustrating diversity and interconnectedness. Despite the hurdles, the recommendations presented provide direction and guidance for educators, industry partners, and policymakers to work together to bridge the soft skills gap. As we mark the first anniversary of this inquiry, it serves as a reminder of the continuing relevance of soft skills in defining the future of IT professionals. The IT industry’s dynamic nature needs a continuing commitment to developing well-rounded, adaptive, and socially conscious professionals. This can be achieved through new educational methodology settings and collaborative initiatives.This systematic literature review is a valid foundation for future studies. Moreover, the results of this study benefit both parties: the decision-makers at the university and the industry of the job market. The notes and the outcome of this study are vitally important in decreasing the unemployment rate among new graduates of IT and other scientific fields. In addition to that, according to the results, one of the important points raised in this study is cooperation, bridging the gap, and creating a swift transition of final-year students and graduates to the employment environment. For information technology industries to remain competitive in global markets, the soft skills deficiencies revealed in the studies must be eliminated. For this reason, higher education institutions and industries should cooperate to invest in the education system. Students studying information technology should be provided with the necessary professional and soft skills. Also, researchers should develop instructional designs that align with the results identified for sustainable education. Finally, this systematic literature review adds knowledge for further investigations on dynamic soft skills elements in the IT field.The results of this study are expected to contribute to understanding the functionality and necessity of soft skills in the behavioral sciences literature. They are also expected to contribute to methodological innovations by illustrating how systematic literature review methods such as the PRISMA technique can be used effectively in behavioral science research."
